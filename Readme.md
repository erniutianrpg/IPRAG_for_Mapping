# An End-to-End Framework for Updating Incomplete Architectural Documentation

This repository contains the dataset, implementation, and experimental results for our proposed framework

## Overview

Software architecture documentation is often outdated or incomplete, posing challenges for software maintenance and evolution. To address this issue, we propose an end-to-end framework that automatically updates architectural documentation through a structured pipeline consisting of four main stages:

1. **Documented Module Extraction**
    Extract architectural document modules from existing incomplete documentation using LLMs.
2. **Code-to-architecture Mapping Generation**
    Establish mappings between the extracted documented modules and source code to capture the DM mappings and UM mappings between modules and code. (DM mapping: mapping for Documented Module, UM mapping: mapping for Unocumented Module)
3. **Mapping Fusion using Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)**
    Integrate mapping outputs generated by diverse methods through a MoE model, which dynamically weights the contribution of each expert method to enhance mapping accuracy.
4. **Architecture Documentation Generation**
    Generate the documentation for files belonging to unocumented module, which supports the updation for the original incomplete documentation.
