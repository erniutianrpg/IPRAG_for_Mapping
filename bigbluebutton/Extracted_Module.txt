		"Frontends other DDP events including method calls to send events to akka-apps Frontends handle completely the Streamer redis events: Cursor, Annotations, External video share. Apps akka. BigBlueButton Apps is the main application that pulls together the different applications to provide real-time collaboration in the meeting. Below is a diagram of the different components of Apps Akka. Communication between apps and FreeSWITCH Event Socket Layer (fsels) uses messages through redis pubsub."
		"If more than one backend is running, bbb-web splits the load in round-robin fashion by assigning an instanceId. BBB web. BigBlueButton web application is a Java-based application written in Scala. The PDF document is then converted into scalable vector graphics (SVG) via bbb-web."
		"FSESL akka. Communication between apps and FreeSWITCH Event Socket Layer (fsels) uses messages through redis pubsub."
		"FSESL akka. We have extracted out the component that integrates with FreeSWITCH into itâ€™s own application. FreeSWITCH. FreeSWITCH provides the voice conferencing capability in BigBlueButton. FreeSWITCH can also be integrated with VOIP providers so that users who are not able to join using the headset will be able to call in using their phone. A user can join the voice conference (running in FreeSWITCH) from the BigBlueButton HTML5 client or through the phone."
		"Presentation conversion flow. The diagram below describes the flow of the presentation conversion."
		"Redis DB. When a meeting is recorded, all events are stored in Redis DB."
		"Redis PubSub. Redis PubSub provides a communication channel between different applications running on the BigBlueButton server. Communication between apps and FreeSWITCH Event Socket Layer (fsels) uses messages through redis pubsub. The conversion process sends progress messages to the client through the Redis pubsub."
