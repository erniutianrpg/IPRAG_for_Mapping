This code implements a singleton EJB cache for `AudioFile` objects using Google's Guava library. The cache stores audio files keyed by `IdAndBitrate` pairs, with a maximum size defined in global constants. It tracks cache hits/misses and calculates hit rates. Key methods include `getIfPresent` (retrieves cached files), `put` (stores files), and `clear` (invalidates cache). The cache is thread-safe with synchronized counters and initialized via `@PostConstruct`.
