The `LameUtil` class provides utility methods for working with the LAME MP3 encoder/decoder. It initializes by copying `lame.exe` from the classpath to the working directory if missing. It offers two main functions: `encode()` to convert audio files to MP3 with a specified bitrate, and `decode()` to convert MP3 files back to WAV. Both methods use `execLame()` to execute LAME commands and verify output file creation. The class handles Windows-specific execution and stream management.
