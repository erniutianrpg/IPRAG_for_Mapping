This code manages configuration settings for EJBs (Enterprise Java Beans) by loading them from an XML file (`ejbconfig.xml`). It uses XStream for XML deserialization, checks if the file has been modified before reloading, and caches the last modified timestamp to avoid unnecessary reloads. The `ejbs` map stores the configuration data, which can be accessed via `getEJBs()`. The `reconfigurable` flag indicates whether dynamic reconfiguration is allowed. The code ensures efficient updates by only reloading when the file changes.
