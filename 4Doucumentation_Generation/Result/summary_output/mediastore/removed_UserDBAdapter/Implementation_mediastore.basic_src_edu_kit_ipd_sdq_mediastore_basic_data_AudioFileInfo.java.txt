The `AudioFileInfo` class is a serializable data transfer object (DTO) that stores metadata about an audio file, including ID, album, artist, bitrate, genre, release year, title, and uploader. It provides getters and setters for all fields, a method to generate a filename (combining artist and title), and a `toString()` method for representation. This class is used to transfer audio file information between client and database layers without direct database entity dependencies.
