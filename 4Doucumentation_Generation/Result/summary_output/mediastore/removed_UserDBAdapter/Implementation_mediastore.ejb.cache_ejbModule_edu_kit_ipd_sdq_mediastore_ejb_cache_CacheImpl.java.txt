The `CacheImpl` class is a stateless EJB that acts as a caching layer for audio file downloads. It checks if requested audio files (with specific bitrates) are cached in a `CacheSingleton`. If cached, it returns them; otherwise, it fetches them from a downstream `IDownload` service, caches them, and returns the results. It also provides a method to clear the cache. The cache improves performance by reducing redundant downloads and handles file content conversion when needed.
