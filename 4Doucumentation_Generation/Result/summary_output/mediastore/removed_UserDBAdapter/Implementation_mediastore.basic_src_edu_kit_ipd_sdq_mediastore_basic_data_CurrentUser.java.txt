The `CurrentUser` class is a serializable Java bean that stores basic user information including ID, first name, last name, email, and a password hash. It provides constructors (default and parameterized) and standard getter/setter methods for accessing and modifying these fields. The `toString()` method returns a string representation of the user data (excluding the password hash for security). This class serves as a data container for user information in the Media Store application. (98 words)
