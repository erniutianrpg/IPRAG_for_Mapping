This code defines a local EJB (Enterprise JavaBean) interface `IDownloadCacheLocal` that extends the `IDownloadCache` interface. The `@Local` annotation indicates it's designed for local access within the same JVM. The interface itself is empty, inheriting all functionality from its parent interface, suggesting it's likely used for type-specific dependency injection or to provide a local view of the download cache functionality in a Java EE application. The header comments indicate this is part of a media store system under GPLv3 license.
