The `PropertiesException` class is a custom exception that extends `AppException`, used to handle property-related errors. It provides two constructors: one accepting an error message, and another accepting both a message and a cause (another throwable). This allows for creating exceptions with descriptive messages and optional underlying causes. The class includes a serial version UID for serialization compatibility. (58 words)
