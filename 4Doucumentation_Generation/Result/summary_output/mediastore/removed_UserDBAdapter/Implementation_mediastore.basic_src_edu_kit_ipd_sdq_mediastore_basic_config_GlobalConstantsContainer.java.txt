This code defines a `GlobalConstantsContainer` class that manages application configuration properties loaded from a "GlobalConstantsContainer.properties" file. It provides static methods to access specific properties like temporary directory path, file directory, and cache capacity. The class caches the properties and checks for file modifications to reload them if changed. Properties are loaded only once or when the file is updated, improving efficiency. The class handles file I/O operations and includes basic error handling for property access.
