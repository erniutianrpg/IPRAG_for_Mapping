The `FSUtil` class provides utility methods for file system operations, including:
1. Generating temporary filenames with unique timestamps
2. Writing file content (local or remote) to specified paths or temp files
3. Reading files into byte arrays (with optional file deletion)
4. Converting between byte arrays and file paths
5. Determining appropriate file extensions (.mp3 for single files, .zip for multiple)
6. Handling both local and remote file content through the `FileContent` hierarchy

The methods support basic file I/O operations with error handling and temporary file management.
