This code implements a WAV file reader/writer in Java. Key functionalities include:

1. Reading and writing WAV files with proper header parsing/creation
2. Supporting multiple audio formats (int, long, double) with sample conversion
3. Handling different channel configurations, sample rates, and bit depths
4. Providing methods for frame-by-frame reading/writing of audio data
5. Including validation for WAV file structure and parameters
6. Maintaining internal buffering for efficient I/O operations

The class supports both little-endian reading/writing and includes utilities for displaying file metadata. It enforces proper WAV file format specifications and provides error checking throughout operations.
