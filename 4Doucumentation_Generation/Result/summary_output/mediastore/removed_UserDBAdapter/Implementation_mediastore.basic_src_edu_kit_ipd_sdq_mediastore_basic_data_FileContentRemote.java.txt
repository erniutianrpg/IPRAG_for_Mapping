The `FileContentRemote` class extends `FileContent` and represents file content stored remotely. It contains a byte array to store the file data, with getter and setter methods for accessing/modifying it. The `isLocal()` method overrides the parent class to return `false`, indicating the content is not stored locally. This class is serializable (as shown by the `serialVersionUID`). In essence, it's a simple data container for remote file content. (98 words)
