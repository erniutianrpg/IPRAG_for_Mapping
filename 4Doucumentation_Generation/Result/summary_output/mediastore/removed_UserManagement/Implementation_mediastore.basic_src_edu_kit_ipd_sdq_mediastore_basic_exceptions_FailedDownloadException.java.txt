This code defines a custom exception class `FailedDownloadException` that extends `AppException`. It's used to indicate a failed download attempt, specifically when an audio file isn't found. The exception takes a filename as input and generates an error message in German ("AudioFile [filename] wurde nicht gefunden" - "AudioFile [filename] was not found"). The class includes a serial version UID for serialization purposes.
