This code implements a singleton EJB cache for `AudioFile` objects using Google's Guava library. It caches audio files keyed by `IdAndBitrate` pairs, tracks cache hits/misses, calculates hit rates, and allows clearing the cache. The cache has a configurable maximum size and provides thread-safe operations for getting, putting, and clearing cached items while monitoring performance through hit rate statistics.
