This code manages configuration settings for EJBs (Enterprise Java Beans) by loading them from an XML file (`ejbconfig.xml`). It uses XStream for XML parsing and checks the file's timestamp to avoid reloading if unchanged. The configuration includes EJB details with provided and required interfaces. The `reconfigurable` flag indicates if dynamic reconfiguration is allowed. Key methods include `loadConfig()` for loading/updating settings and `getEJBs()` to retrieve the EJB map.
