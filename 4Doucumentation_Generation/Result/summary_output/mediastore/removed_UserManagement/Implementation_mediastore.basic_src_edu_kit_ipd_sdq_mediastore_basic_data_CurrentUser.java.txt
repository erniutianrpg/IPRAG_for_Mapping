The `CurrentUser` class is a serializable Java bean that represents a user in a media store system. It stores user details including ID, first name, last name, email, and a password hash. The class provides constructors (default and parameterized) and standard getter/setter methods for accessing and modifying these fields. The `toString()` method returns a string representation of the user's data (excluding the password hash for security). This class serves as a data transfer object for user information.
