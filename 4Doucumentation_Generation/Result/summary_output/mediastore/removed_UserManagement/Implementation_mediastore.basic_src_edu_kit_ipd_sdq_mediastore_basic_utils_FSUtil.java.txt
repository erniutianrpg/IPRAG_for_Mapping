The `FSUtil` class provides utility methods for file system operations, including:
1. Generating temporary filenames with unique timestamps
2. Writing file content (local or remote) to specified paths
3. Reading files into byte arrays
4. Creating and deleting temporary files
5. Converting between file paths and byte arrays
6. Determining appropriate file extensions (mp3/zip) based on requested file count
All methods handle both local and remote file content with proper error handling for IO operations.
