This code defines a `RequiredInterface` class representing a required service interface in a media store system. It stores the interface name (e.g., "IDownload") and a reference to a matching `ProvidedInterface`. The class includes a constructor, getter methods for both fields, and a `toString()` method that formats the data for display. The `@XStreamAlias` annotation enables XML serialization with the tag "RequiredInterface". Essentially, it models a dependency between components where one requires an interface that another component provides. (98 words)
