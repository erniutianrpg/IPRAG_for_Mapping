The code defines a remote EJB (Enterprise JavaBean) interface `IDownloadCacheRemote` that extends the `IDownloadCache` interface. This interface is part of a media store application and is marked with `@Remote`, indicating it's designed for remote method invocation across JVMs. The interface itself is empty, inheriting all functionality from its parent interface, suggesting it serves as a remote access point for download caching operations in a distributed system. The code includes standard GPLv3 licensing information.
