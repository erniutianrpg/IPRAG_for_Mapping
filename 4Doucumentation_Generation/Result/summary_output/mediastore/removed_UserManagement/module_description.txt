This module implements a distributed media store system with enterprise-grade features including audio file management, user authentication, and caching mechanisms. It provides core functionality for downloading, uploading, and converting audio files while maintaining a configurable cache to optimize performance. The system follows EJB architecture with both local and remote interfaces, handles various media-specific exceptions, and includes utilities for file operations, JNDI lookups, and configuration management. User management features support secure registration and login with password hashing. The module is designed as a scalable backend system with proper separation of concerns between business logic, data transfer objects, and infrastructure components.
