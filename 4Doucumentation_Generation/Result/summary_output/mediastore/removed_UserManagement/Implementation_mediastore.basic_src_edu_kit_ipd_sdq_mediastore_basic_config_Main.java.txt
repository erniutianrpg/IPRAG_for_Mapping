This code creates a configuration file (`ejbconfig.xml`) for an EJB-based media store application. It defines multiple EJBs (Enterprise Java Beans) with their provided and required interfaces, then serializes this configuration to XML using XStream. Finally, it loads and prints the configuration to verify it. The EJBs represent various components like audio watermarking, cache, facade, media management, etc., with their dependencies mapped through interfaces.
