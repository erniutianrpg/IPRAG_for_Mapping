This code provides a utility class `JNDIUtil` for JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface) lookups in an EJB (Enterprise JavaBeans) environment. The `find` method constructs a JNDI name based on the provided interface (`ProvidedInterface`) and whether the call is local or remote, then performs the lookup using an `InitialContext`. The JNDI name format varies depending on the call type (local/remote) and includes app/global paths, module name, bean name, and interface type. The result is the looked-up EJB object.
