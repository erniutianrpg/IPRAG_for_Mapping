The `AudioFileInfo` class is a serializable data transfer object (DTO) that stores metadata about audio files, including ID, album, artist, bitrate, genre, release year, title, and uploader. It provides getters and setters for all fields and includes a method to generate a filename in the format "Artist - Title.mp3" (with spaces replaced by underscores). This class is used to transfer audio file information between client and database layers without direct dependencies on database entities.
