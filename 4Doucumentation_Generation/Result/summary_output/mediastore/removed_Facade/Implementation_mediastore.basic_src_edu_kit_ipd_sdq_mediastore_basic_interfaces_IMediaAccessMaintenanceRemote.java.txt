This code defines a remote EJB (Enterprise JavaBean) interface `IMediaAccessMaintenanceRemote` that extends `IMediaAccessMaintenance`. The `@Remote` annotation indicates it's accessible remotely, allowing clients to invoke its methods across JVMs. The interface itself is empty, inheriting all functionality from its parent interface. It's part of a media store system licensed under GPLv3.
