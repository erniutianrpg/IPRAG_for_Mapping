This code defines a `SessionBean` class, a managed JavaServer Faces (JSF) bean that maintains user session information. It tracks whether a user is logged in (`isLoggedIn`) and stores user details (`currentUser`) via getter and setter methods. The bean is session-scoped, meaning it persists throughout a user's session. It's part of a media store application and handles basic user authentication state.
