This code implements a JSF managed bean (`DownloadBean`) for handling audio file downloads in a media store web application. It provides functionality to: 
1. Retrieve a list of available audio files
2. Allow users to select multiple files for download
3. Download selected files either as individual MP3s or a ZIP archive
4. Handle different bitrate options
5. Manage download requests through a facade interface
6. Clean up temporary files after download

The bean maintains download state, validates selections, and streams content to the user.
