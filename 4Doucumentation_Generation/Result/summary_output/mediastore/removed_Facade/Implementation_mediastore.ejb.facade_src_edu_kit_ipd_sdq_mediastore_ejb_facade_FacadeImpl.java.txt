The `FacadeImpl` class is a stateless EJB that acts as a facade for media store operations. It provides methods for user management (registration, login) and media handling (uploading audio files, downloading files, retrieving file lists). The class delegates these operations to underlying `IUserManagement` and `IMediaManagement` interfaces, handling file conversions and remote/local calls as needed. It serves as a central access point for client interactions with the media store system.
