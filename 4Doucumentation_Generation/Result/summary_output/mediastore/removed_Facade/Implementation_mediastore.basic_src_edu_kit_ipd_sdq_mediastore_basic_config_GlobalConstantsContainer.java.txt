This code defines a `GlobalConstantsContainer` class that manages application configuration properties loaded from a "GlobalConstantsContainer.properties" file. It provides static methods to access specific properties like temporary directory path, file directory, and cache capacity. The class implements lazy loading and auto-reloading of properties when the file is modified, using a timestamp check. Properties are stored in memory and accessed through getter methods, with values converted to appropriate types (e.g., integer for cache capacity). The code handles file I/O operations and includes basic error handling for property loading.
