The `FileContent` abstract class provides functionality to convert between local and remote file representations. The `convertIfNeeded()` method checks if the current file content (local or remote) matches the desired type. If not, it converts local files to remote by reading bytes and deleting the local file, or remote files to local by writing bytes to a new file. The method returns the converted content or the original if no conversion was needed. This enables flexible handling of file storage locations.
