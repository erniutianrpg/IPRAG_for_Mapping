This module implements a distributed media store system with EJB-based architecture, providing core functionality for audio file management including upload, download, and caching operations. It features a facade pattern for centralized access to business services, user authentication, and session management, along with configurable EJB components for interface handling. The system supports both local and remote file operations, includes exception handling for various failure scenarios, and offers web-based interaction through JSF managed beans. Configuration is managed via XML serialization, while utilities handle file operations, JNDI lookups, and message display, creating a comprehensive media storage and retrieval platform.
