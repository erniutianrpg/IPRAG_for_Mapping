The `IFacade` interface defines core operations for a media store system, including user registration/login (`register`, `login`), file management (`getFileList`, `upload`, `download`), and a download test method. It handles audio files with metadata (`AudioFile`, `AudioFileInfo`) and supports different bitrates for downloads. The interface throws custom exceptions for failures like invalid login, upload/download errors, or existing users. It extends `IBusinessInterface` and uses RMI/JNDI for remote operations. (98 words)
