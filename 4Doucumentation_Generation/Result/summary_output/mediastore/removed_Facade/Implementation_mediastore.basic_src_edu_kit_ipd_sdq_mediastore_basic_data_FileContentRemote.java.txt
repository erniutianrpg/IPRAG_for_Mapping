The `FileContentRemote` class extends `FileContent` and represents remote file content. It stores file data as a byte array (`bytes`) with getter and setter methods. The `isLocal()` method overrides the parent class to return `false`, indicating the content is not stored locally. This class is serializable (as shown by `serialVersionUID`) for network transmission. (Words: 56)
