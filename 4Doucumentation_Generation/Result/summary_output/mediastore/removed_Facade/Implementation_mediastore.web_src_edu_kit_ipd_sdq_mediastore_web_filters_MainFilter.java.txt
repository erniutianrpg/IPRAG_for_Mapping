This code implements a servlet filter that controls access to web pages based on user authentication. It checks if a user is logged in (via `SessionBean`) and redirects them accordingly: unauthenticated users are sent to the login page, while authenticated users trying to access login/register pages are redirected to the main page. It excludes static resources (.js, .css, .png) from filtering. The filter also handles logout by clearing the session. Essentially, it enforces authentication requirements for protected pages.
