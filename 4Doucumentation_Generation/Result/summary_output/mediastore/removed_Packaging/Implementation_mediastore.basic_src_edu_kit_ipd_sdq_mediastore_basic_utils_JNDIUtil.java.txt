The `JNDIUtil` class provides a utility method `find()` to locate EJBs (Enterprise Java Beans) via JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface). It constructs the appropriate JNDI name based on whether the call is local or remote, using the provided interface (`ProvidedInterface`) and configuration details (`EJB`). The method initializes a context with specific properties, builds the JNDI name with the correct path and interface type (Local/Remote), and performs the lookup to return the EJB instance.
