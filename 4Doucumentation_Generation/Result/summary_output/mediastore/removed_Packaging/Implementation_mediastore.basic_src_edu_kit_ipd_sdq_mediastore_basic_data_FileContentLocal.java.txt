The `FileContentLocal` class extends `FileContent` and represents a local file by storing its `Path`. It provides getter/setter methods for the path and overrides `isLocal()` to always return `true`, indicating the file is local. This class is serializable (as indicated by the `serialVersionUID`). In essence, it's a simple wrapper for local file paths with type identification. (98 words)
