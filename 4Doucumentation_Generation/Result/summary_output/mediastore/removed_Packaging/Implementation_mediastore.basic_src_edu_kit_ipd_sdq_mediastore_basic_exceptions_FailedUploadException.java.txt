The code defines a custom exception class `FailedUploadException` that extends `AppException`. It's used to indicate failures during file uploads, specifically audio files. The exception constructor takes a filename and a `Throwable` cause, creating an error message in German that states "Error while saving the audio [file]". This provides a specific exception type for handling upload failures in the media store application.
