The `RequiredInterface` class represents a required interface in a media store configuration. It stores a name (e.g., "IDownload") and a reference to a `ProvidedInterface` object. The class provides getters for these fields and a `toString()` method that formats the data as a string with indentation. The `@XStreamAlias` annotation enables XML serialization with the tag "RequiredInterface". In essence, this class models a dependency between components in the system. (98 words)
