This code manages configuration settings for EJBs (Enterprise Java Beans) loaded from an XML file (`ejbconfig.xml`). It checks if the file has been modified since the last load using timestamps. If unchanged, it skips reloading; otherwise, it parses the XML using XStream to update the EJB configurations. The `ejbs` map stores the configurations, and `reconfigurable` indicates if dynamic reloading is enabled. The class provides methods to access these EJBs and the reconfigurable flag.
