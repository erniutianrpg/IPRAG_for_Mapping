The code defines a custom exception class `PropertiesException` that extends `AppException`. It provides two constructors: one that accepts an error message, and another that accepts both a message and a cause (throwable). This exception is used to handle property-related errors in the application. The class includes a serial version UID for serialization compatibility. (58 words)
