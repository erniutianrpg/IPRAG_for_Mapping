The code defines an empty Java interface `IDownloadCache` that extends another interface `IDownload`. This suggests it's meant to provide caching functionality for downloads, but contains no actual methods (likely to be implemented by concrete classes). The interface is part of a media store system and is released under GNU GPL v3 license.
