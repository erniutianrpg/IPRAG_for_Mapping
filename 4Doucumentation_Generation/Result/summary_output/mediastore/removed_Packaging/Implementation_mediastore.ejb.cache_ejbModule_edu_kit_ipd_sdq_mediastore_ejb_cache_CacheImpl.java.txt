This code implements a caching mechanism for audio file downloads in a media store application. The `CacheImpl` class acts as a wrapper around a `CacheSingleton` to provide non-blocking access to cached audio files. When a download request is made, it first checks the cache for requested files. If files are found, they're returned; if not, it fetches them from the next service (`IDownload`), caches them, and returns them. The cache can also be cleared. The class handles file conversion and supports both local and remote calls.
