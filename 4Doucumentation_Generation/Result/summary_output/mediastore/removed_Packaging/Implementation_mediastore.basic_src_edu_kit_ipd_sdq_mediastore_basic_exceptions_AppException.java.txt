This code defines an abstract `AppException` class that extends Java's `Exception` class. It provides three constructors for creating exceptions: a default constructor, one with a custom message, and one with both a message and a cause (another throwable). This serves as a base class for custom exceptions in the application, following standard exception handling patterns. The class is part of a media store application's basic exception handling infrastructure.
