This code implements a caching mechanism for audio file downloads in a media store application. The `CacheImpl` class acts as a wrapper around a `CacheSingleton` to provide non-blocking data fetching. When audio files are requested, it first checks the cache. If files aren't cached, it fetches them from the next service (`IDownload`), caches them, and returns all files. The cache can also be cleared. The class supports both local and remote interfaces for download and cache maintenance operations.
