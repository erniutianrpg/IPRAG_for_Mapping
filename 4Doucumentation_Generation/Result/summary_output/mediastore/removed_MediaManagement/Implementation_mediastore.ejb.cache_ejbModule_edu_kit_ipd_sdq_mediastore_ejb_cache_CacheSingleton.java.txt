This code implements a singleton EJB cache for audio files using Google's Guava library. It stores `AudioFile` objects keyed by `IdAndBitrate` pairs, with a configurable maximum size. The cache tracks hits and misses, calculates hit rates, and provides methods to get, put, and clear cached items. It's thread-safe with synchronized counters and uses BMT (Bean-Managed Transactions). The cache is initialized post-construction with a specified capacity from global constants.
