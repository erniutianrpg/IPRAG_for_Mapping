The `FSUtil` class provides file system utility methods for handling file operations in a media store application. Key functionalities include: generating temporary filenames, writing file content (both local and remote) to disk, reading files into memory, converting between byte arrays and file paths, and determining appropriate file extensions (.mp3 or .zip) based on download requests. It handles both local file paths and remote byte arrays, with methods for creating necessary directories and cleaning up temporary files.
