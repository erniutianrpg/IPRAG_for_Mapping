This code manages EJB (Enterprise Java Beans) configurations loaded from an XML file (`ejbconfig.xml`). It checks if the file has been modified before reloading to avoid unnecessary updates. The `XStream` library parses the XML into a `Map` of `EJB` objects, tracking the last modified timestamp. The configuration can be retrieved via `getEJBs()` and checked for reconfigurability with `isReconfigurable()`. The class ensures efficient loading by only updating when the file changes.
