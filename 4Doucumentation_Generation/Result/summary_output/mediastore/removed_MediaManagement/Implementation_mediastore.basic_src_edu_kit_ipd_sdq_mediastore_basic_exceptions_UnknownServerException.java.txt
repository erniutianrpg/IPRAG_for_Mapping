This code defines a custom exception class `UnknownServerException` that extends `AppException`. It represents an unknown server error scenario, providing a default error message "Unknown server ERROR" when thrown. The exception is part of a media store application and follows standard Java exception practices with a serial version UID for serialization compatibility.
