This code defines an `IDownload` interface that extends `IBusinessInterface`. It declares a method `download()` which takes a list of audio file IDs, bitrates, a downloader's login, and a local flag as parameters. The method returns a list of `AudioFile` objects and may throw `FailedDownloadException` or `NamingException`. Its purpose is to provide a contract for downloading audio files with specified bitrates, handling both local and remote operations. The interface is part of a media store system under GNU GPLv3 license.
