The code defines a remote EJB (Enterprise JavaBean) interface `ICacheMaintenanceRemote` that extends `ICacheMaintenance`. It serves as a remote interface for cache maintenance operations, allowing clients to interact with the cache maintenance functionality across JVM boundaries. The interface is marked with `@Remote`, indicating it's accessible remotely. The actual functionality is inherited from the parent interface `ICacheMaintenance` (not shown here). The code is part of a media store system licensed under GPLv3.
