This code defines a `GlobalConstantsContainer` class that manages application configuration properties loaded from a "GlobalConstantsContainer.properties" file. It provides static methods to access specific properties like temporary directory path, file directory, and cache capacity. The class implements lazy loading and checks for file modifications to reload properties if changed. Properties are cached until the file is modified, improving performance while maintaining up-to-date values. The class handles file I/O operations and includes basic error handling for property access.
