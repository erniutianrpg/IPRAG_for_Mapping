This module implements a comprehensive media store system designed for managing and distributing audio files through a distributed enterprise architecture. The core functionality revolves around audio file storage, retrieval, conversion, and caching, with support for both local and remote operations through EJBs (Enterprise Java Beans). The system provides user authentication, file upload/download capabilities, metadata management, and audio format conversion, while employing a sophisticated caching mechanism to optimize performance. Configuration management handles component dependencies and interface bindings, with robust exception handling throughout the application layers. The architecture supports both web-based access through servlet filters and direct EJB interactions, making it suitable for distributed deployment scenarios.
