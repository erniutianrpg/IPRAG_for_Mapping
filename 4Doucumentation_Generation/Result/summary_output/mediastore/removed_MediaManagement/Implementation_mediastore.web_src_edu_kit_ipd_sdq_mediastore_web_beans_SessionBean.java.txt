The `SessionBean` is a managed, session-scoped Java bean that tracks user login state in a web application. It stores a `CurrentUser` object and a boolean `isLoggedIn` flag to indicate authentication status. The bean provides getter and setter methods for the current user data, allowing other components to access or modify the logged-in user's information during the session. It's part of a media store web application's backend functionality.
