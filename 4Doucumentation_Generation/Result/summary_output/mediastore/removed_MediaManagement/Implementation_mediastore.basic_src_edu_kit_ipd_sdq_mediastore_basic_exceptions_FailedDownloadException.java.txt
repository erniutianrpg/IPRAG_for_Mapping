This code defines a custom `FailedDownloadException` class that extends `AppException`. It's used to indicate a failed file download, specifically when an audio file isn't found. The exception takes a filename as input and generates an error message in German ("AudioFile [filename] wurde nicht gefunden" - "AudioFile [filename] was not found"). This is part of a media store application's error handling system.
