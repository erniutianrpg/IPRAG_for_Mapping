This code creates a configuration file (`ejbconfig.xml`) for an EJB-based media store application. It defines multiple EJBs (Enterprise Java Beans) with their provided and required interfaces, establishing dependencies between components. The EJBs are then serialized to XML using XStream. Finally, it loads and prints the configuration to verify the setup. Essentially, it's a configuration generator for a distributed media store system's backend services.
