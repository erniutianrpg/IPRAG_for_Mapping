This code defines an abstract `DbException` class that extends `AppException`, serving as a base for database-related exceptions. It provides three constructors: a default one, one accepting an error message, and another accepting both a message and a cause (another Throwable). The class inherits standard exception handling functionality while specializing for database errors. The serialVersionUID ensures serialization compatibility. (94 words)
