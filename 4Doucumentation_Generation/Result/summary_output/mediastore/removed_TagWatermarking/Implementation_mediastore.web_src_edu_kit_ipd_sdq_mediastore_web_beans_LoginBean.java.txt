The `LoginBean` is a JSF managed bean that handles user authentication. It collects username and password inputs, validates them via the `IFacade` interface, and upon successful login, stores the user data in the session. If login fails due to incorrect credentials or server issues, it displays error messages and returns to the login page. Successful authentication redirects to the index page. The bean is view-scoped and manages session state via `SessionBean`.
