This code implements an audio watermarking EJB that embeds a user's login information as an inaudible watermark into audio files during download. Key functionalities include:

1. Converts MP3 files to WAV format
2. Embeds a binary representation of the downloader's login as high/low frequency sine waves in the audio
3. Converts back to MP3 at the requested bitrate
4. Preserves original MP3 tags throughout the process
5. Handles both local and remote file operations

The watermark is added by modifying audio samples with low-amplitude sine waves (10kHz for '1', 1Hz for '0') at 0.1-second intervals. The process maintains audio quality while embedding traceable user information.
