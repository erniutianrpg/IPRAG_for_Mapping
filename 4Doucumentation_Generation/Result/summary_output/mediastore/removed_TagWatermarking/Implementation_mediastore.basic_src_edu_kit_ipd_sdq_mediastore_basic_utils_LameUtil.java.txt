The `LameUtil` class provides utility methods for working with the LAME MP3 encoder/decoder. It can: 1) Initialize by copying `lame.exe` from classpath to working directory if missing; 2) Encode audio files to MP3 with specified bitrate; and 3) Decode MP3 files to WAV. The class handles file operations and process execution, checking for successful conversions via file existence and size. It works across platforms, appending `.exe` on Windows.
