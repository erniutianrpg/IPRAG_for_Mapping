This code defines an abstract `AppException` class that extends Java's `Exception` class. It provides three constructors: a default no-arg constructor, one that accepts an error message, and another that takes both a message and a cause (Throwable). This serves as a base class for custom application exceptions, following standard exception handling patterns. The class is part of a media store system and is licensed under GPLv3.
