The `WavFile` class provides functionality for reading and writing WAV audio files in Java. Key features include:

1. **File Handling**: Supports opening existing WAV files (`openWavFile`) and creating new ones (`newWavFile`) with configurable parameters like channels, sample rate, and bit depth.

2. **Data Conversion**: Converts between raw audio samples and normalized double values, handling both signed and unsigned data formats.

3. **Reading/Writing**: Methods to read/write frames in different formats (int, long, double) with support for multi-channel audio (interleaved or channel-separated arrays).

4. **Validation**: Checks WAV file headers for correctness and enforces format constraints.

5. **Buffered I/O**: Uses buffered streams for efficient file operations.

The class follows the WAV file specification, handling chunk alignment and format details while providing a clean API for audio processing applications.
