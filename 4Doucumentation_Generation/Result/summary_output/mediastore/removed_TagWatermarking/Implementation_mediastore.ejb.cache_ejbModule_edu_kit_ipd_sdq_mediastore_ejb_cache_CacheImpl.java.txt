This code implements a caching mechanism for audio file downloads in a media store application. The `CacheImpl` class acts as a wrapper around a `CacheSingleton`, checking for cached audio files before fetching uncached ones from a remote `IDownload` service. It handles file conversion if needed, maintains cached files using `IdAndBitrate` as keys, and provides methods to download files and clear the cache. The cache improves performance by serving cached files locally when available.
