The `FileContent` abstract class provides functionality to convert between local and remote file representations. The `convertIfNeeded` method checks if the current file content type (local or remote) matches the desired type, and if not, performs the conversion: local files are converted to remote by reading bytes and deleting the local file, while remote files are converted to local by writing bytes to a new file. The method returns the converted content or the original if no conversion was needed.
