This code defines a local EJB (Enterprise JavaBean) interface `IMediaAccessMaintenanceLocal` that extends `IMediaAccessMaintenance`. The `@Local` annotation indicates it's a local interface for EJBs, meaning it can only be accessed within the same JVM. The interface itself is empty, inheriting all functionality from its parent interface, suggesting it serves as a marker or may be extended by other components. It's part of a media store system licensed under GPLv3.
