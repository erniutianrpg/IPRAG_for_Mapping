This module forms the core infrastructure of a distributed media store system, providing a comprehensive framework for audio file management, caching, and access control. It implements a service-oriented architecture with EJBs (Enterprise Java Beans) for remote and local operations, including media download/upload, watermarking, and database persistence. The system features configurable components through XML and properties files, exception handling for various operational scenarios, and utility classes for audio processing (like LAME encoding/decoding) and JNDI lookups. A caching mechanism optimizes performance by storing frequently accessed audio files, while the modular design supports both local and remote service invocations through clearly defined interfaces. The entire system is built with thread safety, serialization support, and transaction management in mind, licensed under GPLv3.
