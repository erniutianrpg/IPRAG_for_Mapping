This code implements a caching mechanism for audio file downloads in a media store application. The `CacheImpl` class acts as a wrapper around a `CacheSingleton`, checking for cached audio files before downloading missing ones from a backend service. It handles file conversion if needed, caches newly downloaded files, and provides methods to clear the cache. The cache stores audio files keyed by their ID and bitrate, improving performance by avoiding redundant downloads.
