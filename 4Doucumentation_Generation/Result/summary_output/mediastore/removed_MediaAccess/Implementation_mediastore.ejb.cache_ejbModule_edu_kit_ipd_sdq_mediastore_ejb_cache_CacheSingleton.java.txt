This code implements a singleton EJB cache for `AudioFile` objects using Google's Guava library. It stores audio files keyed by `IdAndBitrate` pairs, with a configurable maximum size. The cache tracks hits/misses and calculates hit rates. Key methods include `getIfPresent` (retrieves cached files), `put` (stores files), and `clear` (empties cache). The cache is thread-safe with synchronized counters and follows a BMT (Bean-Managed Transaction) approach.
