This code defines a `GlobalConstantsContainer` class that manages application configuration properties loaded from a "GlobalConstantsContainer.properties" file. It provides static methods to access specific properties like temporary directory path, file directory, and cache capacity. The class caches the properties and only reloads them if the file modification timestamp changes, ensuring efficient access while allowing runtime updates to the configuration file. Properties are loaded once and reused until the file is modified.
