The `JNDIUtil` class provides a utility method `find()` to locate EJBs (Enterprise Java Beans) via JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface). It constructs the appropriate JNDI name based on whether the call is local or remote, using the provided interface (`ProvidedInterface`) and its configuration (`EJB`). The method initializes a context with specific properties, builds the JNDI path with app/global scope, module, bean name, and interface type (Local/Remote), then performs the lookup. The port number is logged for debugging.
