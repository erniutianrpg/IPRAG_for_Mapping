The code defines a custom exception class `FailedUploadException` that extends `AppException`. It's used to indicate failures during file uploads, specifically for audio files. The exception constructor takes a filename and a throwable cause, creating an error message in German that states "Error while saving the audio [file]". This provides more specific error handling for upload failures in the Media Store application.
