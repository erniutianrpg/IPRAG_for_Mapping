The `RequiredInterface` class represents a required interface in a media store configuration. It stores the interface name (e.g., "IDownload") and links to a `ProvidedInterface` object. The class provides constructors, getters for both fields, and a `toString()` method that formats the information with indentation for readability. The `@XStreamAlias` annotation enables XML serialization with the tag "RequiredInterface". This class essentially models a dependency between components in the system. (94 words)
