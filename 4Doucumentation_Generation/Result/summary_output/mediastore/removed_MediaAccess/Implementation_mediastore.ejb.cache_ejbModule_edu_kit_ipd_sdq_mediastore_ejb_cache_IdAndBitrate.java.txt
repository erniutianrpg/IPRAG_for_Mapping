The `IdAndBitrate` class is a simple serializable Java bean that pairs an ID (long) with a bitrate (int). It provides getters/setters for both fields and overrides `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods to compare objects based on their ID and bitrate values. The class is likely used as a key or value object in caching operations within a media store application. (98 words)
