This servlet filter controls access to web pages based on user authentication. It checks if a user is logged in (via `SessionBean`). Unauthenticated users are redirected to the login page, except when accessing login/registration pages. Logged-in users trying to access login/registration are redirected to the main page. It also handles logout by clearing the session. Static resources (JS, CSS, PNG) are allowed through. The filter enforces proper page flow based on authentication status.
