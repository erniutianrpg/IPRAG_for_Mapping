The `EMFManager` class is a singleton that manages the `EntityManagerFactory` for JPA persistence. It provides methods to configure, retrieve, and clear the factory, supporting both in-memory HSQLDB and MySQL/MariaDB databases. Configuration can be set via properties or Java environment variables, with defaults for in-memory usage. The class ensures thread-safe access and proper resource cleanup.
