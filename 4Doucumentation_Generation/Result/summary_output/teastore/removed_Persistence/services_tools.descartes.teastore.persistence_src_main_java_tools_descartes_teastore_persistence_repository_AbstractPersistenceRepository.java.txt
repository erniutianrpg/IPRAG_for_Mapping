This abstract class provides a generic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) repository implementation for JPA entities. It includes methods for entity creation, retrieval (by ID or all with pagination support), updates, and deletion. The class uses EntityManager for database operations and requires concrete implementations to specify entity types and ID handling. It manages transactions and resources (opening/closing EntityManager) internally.
