The `OrderItem` class represents an item in a shopping cart or order, storing its ID, associated product ID, order ID, quantity, and unit price in cents. It includes constructors (default and copy), getters/setters for all fields, and overrides `equals()` and `hashCode()` for comparison based on ID, order ID, and product ID. This entity class is designed for use in e-commerce systems to manage order items.
