This code implements a RESTful CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoint for managing User entities in a store application. It extends `AbstractCRUDEndpoint` to handle basic operations and adds a custom method to find users by name. The endpoint interacts with `UserRepository` for persistence and checks for maintenance mode before modifications. It returns appropriate HTTP responses, including 404 for missing users. All operations return copies of user data rather than direct references.
