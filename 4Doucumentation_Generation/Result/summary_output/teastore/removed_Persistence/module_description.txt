This module serves as the core persistence and monitoring infrastructure for a TeaStore e-commerce system. It provides comprehensive CRUD operations for all domain entities (users, products, orders, categories) through REST endpoints backed by JPA repositories, while maintaining transactional integrity and cache coherence across distributed instances. The module includes database initialization capabilities with test data generation and maintenance mode handling. Additionally, it implements performance monitoring through Kieker aspects that track method executions and parameters, with RabbitMQ-based log collection and management utilities for viewing, storing, and resetting monitoring data. The system supports both in-memory and relational databases with proper JPA configuration and Java 8 date/time handling.
