This code defines a JPA entity `PersistenceOrderItem` representing an order item (product with quantity in a cart/order). It extends `OrderItem` with persistence capabilities, including auto-generated ID, quantity, price, and relationships to `PersistenceProduct` and `PersistenceOrder`. It includes getters/setters and a `@PostRemove` hook to clear caches. Some inherited setter operations are unsupported to maintain data integrity.
