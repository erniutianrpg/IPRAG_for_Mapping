The `OrderRepository` class is a singleton repository that handles CRUD operations for `Order` entities in a database. It extends `AbstractPersistenceRepository` and provides methods to create, update, and retrieve orders. Key features include creating orders with user associations, updating existing orders, and fetching orders by user ID with pagination support. It uses JPA (`EntityManager`) for database interactions and ensures transactional integrity. The class converts between application-level `Order` objects and persistence-level `PersistenceOrder` entities.
