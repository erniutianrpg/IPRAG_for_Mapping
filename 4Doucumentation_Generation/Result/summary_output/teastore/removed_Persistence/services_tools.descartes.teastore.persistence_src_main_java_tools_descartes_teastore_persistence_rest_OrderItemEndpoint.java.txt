This code implements a RESTful CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoint for managing order items in an e-commerce system. It extends `AbstractCRUDEndpoint` to handle basic operations and adds two custom methods: `listAllForProduct` to fetch order items by product ID, and `listAllForOrder` to fetch them by order ID. The endpoint interacts with `OrderItemRepository` for persistence and checks for maintenance mode before create/delete operations. All methods support pagination via start index and max results parameters.
