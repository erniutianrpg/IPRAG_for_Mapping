This code defines a `Product` entity class with attributes like ID, category ID, name, description, and price in cents. It includes getters and setters for each attribute, a copy constructor, and overrides for `equals()` and `hashCode()` based on ID and category ID. The class serves as a data model for product information, likely used in a RESTful web service, with some setters marked for REST use only.
