The `Order` class is a Java entity representing a customer order in an e-commerce system. It stores order details including ID, user ID, timestamp, total price, shipping address, and credit card information. The class provides getters/setters for all fields, a copy constructor, and overrides `equals()` and `hashCode()` based on ID and user ID. It's designed for REST API use and persistence, with ISO-formatted date fields.
