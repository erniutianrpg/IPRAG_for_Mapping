The `CategoryEndpoint` class is a RESTful service endpoint for performing CRUD operations on `Category` entities. It extends `AbstractCRUDEndpoint` and overrides methods to create, read, update, and delete categories using a `CategoryRepository`. Operations are blocked during maintenance mode. Each method interacts with the repository to persist changes or retrieve data, returning appropriate responses or copies of entities. The endpoint is accessible via the "/categories" path.
