The `LogConsumer` class is a Kieker filter plugin that processes monitoring records received via RabbitMQ. It specifically handles `IMonitoringRecord` instances, printing CPU utilization data and storing all records in `MemoryLogStorage`. If the record type is unknown, it throws an `IllegalStateException`. The class extends `AbstractFilterPlugin` and defines a single input port (`INPUT_PORT_NAME`) for receiving records. (98 words)
