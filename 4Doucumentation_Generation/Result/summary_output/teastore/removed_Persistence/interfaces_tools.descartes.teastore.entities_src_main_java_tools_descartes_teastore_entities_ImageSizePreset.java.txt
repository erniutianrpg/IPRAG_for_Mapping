The `ImageSizePreset` enum defines standard image size presets (like ICON, PORTRAIT, LOGO, etc.) for an e-commerce system, each with specific width and height dimensions. It includes a default size (`STD_IMAGE_SIZE`) set to `FULL` (300x300) and provides a method to retrieve the dimensions (`getSize()`). This helps maintain consistent image sizing across the application. (98 words)
