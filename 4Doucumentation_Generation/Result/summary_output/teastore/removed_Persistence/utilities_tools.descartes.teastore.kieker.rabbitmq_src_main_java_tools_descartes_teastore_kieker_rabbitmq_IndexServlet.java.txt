This code defines a simple `IndexServlet` that serves as an index page for Kieker log management. When accessed via HTTP GET, it returns an HTML page with three links: one to retrieve log files, another to display logs stored in memory, and a third to reset logs. The page displays a heading "Kieker logs" followed by an unordered list of these options. The servlet is mapped to the "/index" URL path.
