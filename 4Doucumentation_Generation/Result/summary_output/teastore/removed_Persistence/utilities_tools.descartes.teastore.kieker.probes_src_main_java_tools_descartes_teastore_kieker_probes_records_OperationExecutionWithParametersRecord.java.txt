This code defines a `OperationExecutionWithParametersRecord` class that extends Kieker's `OperationExecutionRecord` to store execution monitoring data including method parameters and return values. It adds fields for parameter types/values and return type/value, with methods for serialization, deserialization, and equality comparison. The class is used for detailed performance monitoring and tracing in a TeaStore application.
