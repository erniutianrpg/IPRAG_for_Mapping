This code defines a `User` class for a pet supply store, representing user entities with attributes like ID, username, password hash, real name, and email. It includes constructors (default and copy), getters/setters for all fields, and overrides `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods to compare users based on ID and username. The class is designed for REST API use, with persistence considerations noted in the ID setter.
