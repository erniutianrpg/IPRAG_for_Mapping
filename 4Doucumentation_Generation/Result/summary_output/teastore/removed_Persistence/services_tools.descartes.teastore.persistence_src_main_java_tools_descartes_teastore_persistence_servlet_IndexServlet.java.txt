The `IndexServlet` is a simple HTTP servlet mapped to "/index" that provides basic debug information. When accessed via GET or POST requests, it responds with a message indicating it's the persistence module, along with the protocol, server address, port, and context path from the request. This helps deployers and testers verify the module is running correctly.
