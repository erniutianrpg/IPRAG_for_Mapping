This code defines a `PersistenceOrder` entity class that extends an `Order` class for database persistence. It stores order details like timestamps, prices, addresses, and credit card information, with relationships to `PersistenceUser` and `PersistenceOrderItem`. The class includes JPA annotations for database operations, lifecycle hooks (`@PreRemove`, `@PostRemove`) for cleanup, and methods to manage order items and cache invalidation. It handles date formatting and provides standard getters/setters for all fields.
