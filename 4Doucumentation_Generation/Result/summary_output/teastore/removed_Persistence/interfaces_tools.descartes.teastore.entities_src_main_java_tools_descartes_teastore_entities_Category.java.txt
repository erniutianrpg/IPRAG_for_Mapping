The `Category` class is a simple entity representing a product category with an `id`, `name`, and `description`. It includes a default constructor, a copy constructor, getters/setters for all fields, and overrides `equals()` and `hashCode()` based on the `id` field. The class is designed for use in a RESTful service, with the note that the `id` setter is ignored by persistence. The entity follows standard Java bean conventions and includes basic validation in equality checks.
