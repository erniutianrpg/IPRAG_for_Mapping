This code defines an `ImageSizePreset` enum that represents various standard image sizes used in an e-commerce application. Each enum value (like ICON, PORTRAIT, LOGO, etc.) is associated with specific width and height dimensions via an `ImageSize` object. The enum provides a method `getSize()` to retrieve these dimensions and declares `FULL` (300x300) as the standard image size (`STD_IMAGE_SIZE`). This helps maintain consistent image sizing across the application.
