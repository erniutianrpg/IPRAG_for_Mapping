This module forms a comprehensive e-commerce recommendation system with integrated monitoring capabilities. It provides various recommendation algorithms (including collaborative filtering, popularity-based, and order-based approaches) that suggest products based on user behavior and purchase history, while supporting training and periodic retraining of models. The system includes REST endpoints for recommendations and training, session management for user data, and monitoring components that track performance metrics through Kieker-based logging. The module operates as part of a microservice architecture, coordinating with other services while maintaining its own in-memory storage and log management for operational insights.
