The `IndexServlet` is a basic servlet that serves as an entry point for the Recommender Component. It responds to GET and POST requests by returning a simple text message indicating the module is running, along with the protocol, server address, port, and context path from the request. This provides basic debug information for testing and deployment purposes.
