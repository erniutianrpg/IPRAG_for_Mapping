The `TrainingSynchronizer` class manages communication with other services and synchronizes training for a recommender system. It retrieves order and order item data from a persistence service, filters them based on a maximum timestamp (to avoid training on recent data), and triggers the recommender's training. It includes methods to wait for the persistence service to be ready, handle time synchronization between services, and convert timestamps. The class follows a singleton pattern and tracks readiness status for training completion.
