This code implements an in-memory storage for Kieker monitoring records using a thread-safe concurrent queue. It provides static methods to:  
1. `storeRecord()` - Add new records  
2. `getRecords()` - Retrieve all stored records  
3. `clearMemoryStorage()` - Clear the storage  
The class is a singleton (private constructor) and uses `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` for thread-safe operations. Records are stored as `IMonitoringRecord` objects.
