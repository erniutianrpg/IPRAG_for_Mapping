The `OrderItemSet` class represents a user's order in an e-commerce system, storing the user ID, order ID, and a map of product IDs to their purchased quantities. It provides getters and setters for these fields, allowing access and modification of the order data. The class essentially acts as a container for order information, facilitating product recommendation algorithms by tracking which products were bought together.
