The `IndexServlet` is a simple HTTP servlet that serves as an index page for the persistence module. When accessed via GET or POST requests at the "/index" endpoint, it responds with a text message indicating the module is running, along with the protocol, server address, port, and context path from the request. This provides basic debug information for deployers and testers.
