The `LogReaderDaemon` class implements a RabbitMQ-based log reader daemon using Kieker's analysis framework. It continuously retrieves logs from a specified AMQP (RabbitMQ) queue (`kieker`), processes them using a binary deserializer, and forwards them to a `LogConsumer`. The connection uses localhost with credentials and runs until interrupted, handling potential interruptions gracefully. The daemon terminates the analysis controller upon completion or failure.
