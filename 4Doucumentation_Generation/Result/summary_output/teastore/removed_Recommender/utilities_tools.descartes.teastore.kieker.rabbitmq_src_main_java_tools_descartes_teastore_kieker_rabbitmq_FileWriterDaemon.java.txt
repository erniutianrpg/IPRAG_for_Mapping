The `FileWriterDaemon` class is a Runnable that continuously writes monitoring records from memory to log files on disk every 5 seconds. It configures a Kieker FileWriter to store logs in `apache-tomcat-8.5.24/webapps/logs` with unlimited file size and entries. The daemon fetches records from `MemoryLogStorage`, writes them to disk, clears the storage, and repeats until interrupted.
