The `OrderBasedRecommender` is a recommendation algorithm that suggests products frequently bought together with items in a user's current cart. It counts how often other products appear in the same orders as each item in the cart, sums these co-occurrences, and recommends the most frequent products (excluding those already in the cart). If no co-occurrences are found, it throws a `UseFallBackException`. This implements a simple nearest-neighbor approach based on order history.
