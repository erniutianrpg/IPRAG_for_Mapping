This servlet creates a simple HTML index page for accessing Kieker log functionalities. When accessed via GET request (`/index`), it displays a webpage with three links: 1) to get log files, 2) to display logs in memory, and 3) to reset logs. The response is formatted as UTF-8 encoded HTML with basic headings and an unordered list of links. Essentially, it serves as a navigation page for log management operations.
