The `PopularityBasedRecommender` is a recommendation algorithm that suggests products based on their overall popularity. It tracks total purchase counts for each product during preprocessing (`executePreprocessing()`), summing quantities from all users. When recommending (`execute()`), it filters and returns the most popular products not already in the user's current items list. This is a simple, non-personalized approach that prioritizes widely purchased items.
