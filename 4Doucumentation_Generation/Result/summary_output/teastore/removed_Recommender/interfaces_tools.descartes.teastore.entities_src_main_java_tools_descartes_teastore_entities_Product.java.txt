This code defines a `Product` entity class representing items in a store. It includes fields for ID, category ID, name, description, and price in cents, along with getters and setters for each. The class provides a copy constructor, and overrides `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods based on ID and category ID. The entity is designed for REST API use, with some setters marked as ignored by persistence.
