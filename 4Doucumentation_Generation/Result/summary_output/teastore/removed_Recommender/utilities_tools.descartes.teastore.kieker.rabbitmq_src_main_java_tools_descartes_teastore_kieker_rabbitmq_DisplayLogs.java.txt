This code defines a servlet `DisplayLogs` that handles HTTP GET requests at the `/displaylogs` endpoint. When accessed, it retrieves all monitoring records stored in memory via `MemoryLogStorage.getRecords()` and writes each record as a string to the HTTP response. The servlet sets the response encoding to UTF-8 and uses a `PrintWriter` to output the records. Essentially, it provides a simple web interface to view in-memory monitoring logs. (94 words)
