This code defines an abstract RESTful CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoint for managing entities. It provides standard HTTP methods (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting entities, with JSON as the content type. The abstract class requires implementing classes to define the actual persistence operations (createEntity, findEntityById, listAllEntities, updateEntity, deleteEntity). It handles basic validation and returns appropriate HTTP status codes (200 OK, 404 Not Found). The endpoint supports pagination via query parameters for listing entities.
