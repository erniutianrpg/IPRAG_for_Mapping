This code is an abstract AspectJ aspect for monitoring method executions in a Kieker framework. It logs operation execution times and optionally parameter values based on an environment variable (`LOG_PARAMETERS`). The aspect tracks call hierarchy (EOI/ESS), session IDs, and trace IDs. When enabled, it records method signatures, parameters (with special handling for collections, SessionBlob, and ImageSize), and return values. Otherwise, it only logs basic execution data. The monitoring can be disabled or filtered by signature.
