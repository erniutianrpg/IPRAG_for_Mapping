This servlet (`/reset` endpoint) resets logs by: 1) Stopping the log writer, 2) Clearing in-memory log storage, 3) Deleting all log files with "kieker" prefix from a specified folder, and 4) Restarting the log writer. It includes helper methods to recursively delete folders/files. The functionality is triggered via a GET request.
