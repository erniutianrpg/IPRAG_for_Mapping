This code defines an enum `Service` that lists and names the different microservices in a pet supply store system. Each enum value represents a service (Persistence, Recommender, Auth, WebUI, Image) with its corresponding package name. The enum provides a method `getServiceName()` to retrieve the package name for each service. This serves as a centralized reference for service identifiers in the application. (98 words)
