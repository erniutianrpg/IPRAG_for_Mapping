This code implements a `ServletContextListener` that initializes and manages two background daemons (`LogReaderDaemon` and `FileWriterDaemon`) using scheduled executor services. On web app startup (`contextInitialized`), it starts both daemons with a 10-second delay. On shutdown (`contextDestroyed`), it gracefully terminates these services. The `LogReaderDaemon` likely reads logs, while the `FileWriterDaemon` writes them to files. The class includes static methods to manually start/stop the file writer. Basic Log4j configuration is also set up during initialization.
