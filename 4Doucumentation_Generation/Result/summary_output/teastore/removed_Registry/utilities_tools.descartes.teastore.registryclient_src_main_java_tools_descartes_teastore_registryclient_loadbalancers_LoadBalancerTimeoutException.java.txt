The `LoadBalancerTimeoutException` is a custom exception that indicates a timeout occurred during load balancing attempts for a specific service. It extends `RuntimeException` and includes the target service that failed (accessible via `getTargetService()`). This exception is thrown when the load balancer exceeds its retry limit while attempting to connect to a service. (94 words)
