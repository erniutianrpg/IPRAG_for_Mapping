This code provides REST client operations for image services in a load-balanced system. It includes methods to:
1. Retrieve product images (single or multiple) with specified sizes
2. Get web images (single or multiple) with specified sizes 
3. Regenerate images across all instances
The operations use a service load balancer to distribute requests and handle timeouts/errors. Responses are processed and returned as HashMaps (for images) or status codes (for regeneration). The class handles connection pooling and response buffering.
