This module provides a comprehensive infrastructure for a microservices-based e-commerce system (TeaStore), featuring service discovery, load balancing, monitoring, and core entity management. It includes a service registry for dynamic service registration and discovery, client-side load balancing with Ribbon integration, and distributed tracing capabilities through OpenTracing and Kieker. The module also defines the core domain entities (products, orders, users) and provides utilities for REST operations, monitoring via RabbitMQ, and container memory configuration. Together, these components form the backbone for a scalable, observable microservices architecture with proper service coordination, fault tolerance, and performance monitoring capabilities.
