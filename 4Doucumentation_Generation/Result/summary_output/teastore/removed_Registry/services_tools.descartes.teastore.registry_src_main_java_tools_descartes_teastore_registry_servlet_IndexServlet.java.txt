The `IndexServlet` is a basic servlet that handles GET and POST requests at the "/index" endpoint. When accessed, it responds with a message indicating it's the registry module, along with the protocol, server address, port, and context path from the request. The POST request simply delegates to the GET handler. This serves as a simple debug endpoint for deployers and testers to verify the registry is running.
