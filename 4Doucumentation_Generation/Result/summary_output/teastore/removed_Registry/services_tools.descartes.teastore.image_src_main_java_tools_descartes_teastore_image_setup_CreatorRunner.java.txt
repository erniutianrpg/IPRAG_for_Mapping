The `CreatorRunner` class is a Runnable that generates a single product image with random shapes and a category overlay. It creates a BufferedImage using specified parameters (size, shapes count, category image), saves it as a Base64-encoded file in a working directory, and maps the product ID to the generated image ID in an ImageDB. It also tracks the total number of images generated across threads using an AtomicLong counter. Errors during image writing are logged unless caused by thread interruption.
