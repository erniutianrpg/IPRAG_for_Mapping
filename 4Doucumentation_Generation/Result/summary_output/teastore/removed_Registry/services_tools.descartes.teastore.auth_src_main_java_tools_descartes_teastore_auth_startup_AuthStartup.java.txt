This code implements a `ServletContextListener` for initializing and shutting down an authentication service in a microservices architecture. On startup, it registers OpenTracing for monitoring, sets a REST client timeout, pre-initializes load balancers for the persistence service, and registers itself with the service registry. On shutdown, it unregisters from the registry. The class ensures proper integration with the service discovery system and prepares necessary components for operation.
