The `CharResponseWrapper` class extends `HttpServletResponseWrapper` to capture and store HTTP response content in a `CharArrayWriter` instead of sending it directly to the client. It overrides `getWriter()` and `getOutputStream()` to redirect output to an internal buffer, allowing the response data to be accessed later via `toString()`. This is useful for intercepting and processing response content before it's sent to the client. The class effectively acts as a wrapper that buffers the response data in memory.
