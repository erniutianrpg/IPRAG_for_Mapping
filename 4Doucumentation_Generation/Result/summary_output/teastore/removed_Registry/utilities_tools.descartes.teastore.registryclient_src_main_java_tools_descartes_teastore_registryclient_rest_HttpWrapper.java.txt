The `HttpWrapper` class is a utility for wrapping HTTP requests with Kieker monitoring and tracing information. It injects tracing headers (trace ID, session ID, execution order, and call stack depth) into the request builder when monitoring is enabled, facilitating distributed tracing. If no trace exists, it initializes one. The wrapper ensures JSON content type and integrates with Kieker's monitoring framework for performance analysis.
