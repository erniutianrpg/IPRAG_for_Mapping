The `ResponseWrapper` class is a utility that wraps HTTP responses with Kieker monitoring capabilities. It extracts tracing information (trace ID, execution order index, execution stack size, and session ID) from response headers and stores them in thread-local Kieker registries for performance monitoring. If no tracing info is found, it generates default values and logs warnings. This enables distributed tracing across microservices in a TeaStore application.
