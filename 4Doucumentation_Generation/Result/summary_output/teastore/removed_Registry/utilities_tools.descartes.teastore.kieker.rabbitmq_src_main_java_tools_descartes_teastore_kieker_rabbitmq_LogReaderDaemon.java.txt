The `LogReaderDaemon` class implements a RabbitMQ-based log reader daemon that continuously retrieves and processes monitoring logs from a specified AMQP queue (`kieker`). It uses Kieker's analysis framework to configure and connect an AMQP reader (`ChunkingAmqpReader`) with a binary deserializer, then forwards the log records to a `LogConsumer` for processing. The daemon handles interruptions gracefully and ensures proper termination of resources.
