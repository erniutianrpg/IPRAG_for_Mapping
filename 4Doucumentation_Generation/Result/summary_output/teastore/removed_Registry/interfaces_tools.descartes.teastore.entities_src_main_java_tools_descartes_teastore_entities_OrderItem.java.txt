The `OrderItem` class represents an item in a shopping cart or order, storing its ID, associated product ID, order ID, quantity, and unit price in cents. It includes constructors (default and copy), getters/setters for all fields, and overrides `equals()` and `hashCode()` for proper entity comparison. This class serves as a data model for order items in an e-commerce system.
