This code implements a thread-safe in-memory storage for Kieker monitoring records using a `ConcurrentLinkedQueue`. It provides static methods to:  
1. `storeRecord()` - Add new records  
2. `getRecords()` - Retrieve all stored records  
3. `clearMemoryStorage()` - Clear all records  
The class is a singleton (private constructor) and maintains records in a static queue for shared access. (Word count: 58)
