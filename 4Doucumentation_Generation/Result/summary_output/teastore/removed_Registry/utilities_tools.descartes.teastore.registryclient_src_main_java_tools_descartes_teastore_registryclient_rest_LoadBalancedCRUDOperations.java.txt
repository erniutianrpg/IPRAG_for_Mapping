The `LoadBalancedCRUDOperations` class provides load-balanced REST CRUD operations for interacting with microservices. It includes methods for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving entities (`sendEntityForCreation`, `sendEntityForUpdate`, `deleteEntity`, `getEntity`, `getEntities`). Each method uses a service load balancer to distribute requests across available service instances. The class handles exceptions like `NotFoundException` and `LoadBalancerTimeoutException` and supports filtering and pagination for entity retrieval.
