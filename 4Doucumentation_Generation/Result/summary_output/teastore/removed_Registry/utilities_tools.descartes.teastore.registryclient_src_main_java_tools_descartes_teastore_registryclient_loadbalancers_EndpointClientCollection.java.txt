The `EndpointClientCollection` class manages REST clients for load balancing across multiple servers of a microservice. It maintains a concurrent map of `RESTClient` instances keyed by `Server` objects. The class updates clients when servers change (adds new ones, removes old ones) and provides access to specific REST clients. It's designed for a specific service endpoint (defined by `targetService` and `endpointURI`) and handles entities of type `<T>`. The class supports dynamic server updates while maintaining thread safety.
