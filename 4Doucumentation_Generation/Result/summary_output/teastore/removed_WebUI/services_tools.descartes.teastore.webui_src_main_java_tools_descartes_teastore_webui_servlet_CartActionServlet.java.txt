The `CartActionServlet` handles various cart-related actions in an e-commerce system. It processes GET requests to: add/remove products from the cart, update item quantities, proceed to checkout (redirecting to login if not authenticated), and confirm orders by saving user information. The servlet maintains the cart state in a `SessionBlob` and interacts with backend services through `LoadBalancedStoreOperations`. It also validates order details like address and payment information before order confirmation.
