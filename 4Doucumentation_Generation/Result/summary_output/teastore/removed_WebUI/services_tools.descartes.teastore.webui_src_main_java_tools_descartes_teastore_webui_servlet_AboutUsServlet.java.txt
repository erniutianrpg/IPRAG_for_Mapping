The `AboutUsServlet` is a Java servlet that handles GET requests for the "About Us" page of a web application called TeaStore. It retrieves portrait images of team members and logo/icon images using load-balanced operations, sets them as request attributes along with the page title and login status, and forwards the request to a JSP page for rendering. The servlet also checks for cookies before processing the request.
