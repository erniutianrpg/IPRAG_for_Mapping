The `IndexServlet` is a simple servlet that responds to GET and POST requests at the "/index" endpoint. When accessed, it returns a basic text response indicating the persistence module is running, along with the protocol, server address, port, and context path from the request. This provides deployers and testers with debug information about the server's location and configuration. Both POST requests and GET requests produce the same response.
