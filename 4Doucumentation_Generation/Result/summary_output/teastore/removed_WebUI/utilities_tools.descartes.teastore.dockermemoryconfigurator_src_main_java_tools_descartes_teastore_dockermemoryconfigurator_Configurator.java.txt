This Java program configures the Tomcat heap space in a Docker container. It reads the total host memory from `/proc/meminfo` and the container's memory limit from `/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.limit_in_bytes`, then calculates the heap size as a percentage (default 80%) of the container's memory limit. The heap size is written to `/usr/local/tomcat/bin/setenv.sh` as a JVM option (`-Xmx`). If no arguments are provided, it uses the default percentage. The tool ensures proper memory allocation within Docker constraints.
