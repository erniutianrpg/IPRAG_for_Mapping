The `ImageSize` class represents image dimensions with width and height. It includes constructors, getters/setters with validation (ensuring positive values), pixel count calculation, and string parsing/formatting (using "x" as a divider). It also overrides `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` for proper object comparison and string representation. The class can parse strings like "100x200" into `ImageSize` objects.
