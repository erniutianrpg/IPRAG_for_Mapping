The `FileWriterDaemon` class is a Runnable daemon that continuously writes monitoring records from memory to log files on disk every 5 seconds. It configures a Kieker FileWriter to store logs in a specified directory (`apache-tomcat-8.5.24/webapps/logs`) with no size or entry limits. The daemon fetches records from `MemoryLogStorage`, writes them to disk, clears the storage, and repeats until interrupted.
