This code implements a thread-safe in-memory storage for Kieker monitoring records using a `ConcurrentLinkedQueue`. It provides static methods to:  
1. `storeRecord()` - Add new records  
2. `getRecords()` - Retrieve all stored records  
3. `clearMemoryStorage()` - Clear all records  
The class is designed as a singleton (private constructor) with static methods for global access. Records are stored as `IMonitoringRecord` objects. (Word count: 62)
