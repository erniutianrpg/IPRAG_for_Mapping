The `SessionBlob` class is a data container that stores user session information, including user ID (`uid`), session ID (`sid`), a trust token (`token`), an `Order` object, a list of `OrderItem` objects, and a message string. It provides getters and setters for all fields and initializes an empty `Order` upon construction. This class acts as a temporary holder for session-related data in an e-commerce system.
