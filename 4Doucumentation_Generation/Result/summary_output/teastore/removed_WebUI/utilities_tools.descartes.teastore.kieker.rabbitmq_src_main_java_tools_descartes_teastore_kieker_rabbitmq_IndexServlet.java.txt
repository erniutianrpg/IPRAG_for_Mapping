This servlet creates a simple web interface (`/index`) that displays a menu with three options: 1) Access log files, 2) View logs stored in memory, and 3) Reset logs. It responds to GET requests by sending an HTML page with these links. The servlet is part of a system using Kieker (a monitoring tool) and RabbitMQ for log management.
