The `CategoryServlet` handles web requests for product categories in an e-commerce store. It processes GET requests to display products within a specific category, including pagination, product count options, and navigation. POST requests update the number of products displayed per page. The servlet retrieves category and product data from backend services, generates navigation elements, and forwards the data to a JSP page for rendering. It also checks user login status and manages cookies.
