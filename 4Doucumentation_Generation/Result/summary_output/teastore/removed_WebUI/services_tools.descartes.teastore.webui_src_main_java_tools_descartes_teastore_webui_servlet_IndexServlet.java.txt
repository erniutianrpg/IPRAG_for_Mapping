The `IndexServlet` class is a servlet that handles GET requests for the TeaStore's homepage ("/index"). It retrieves and sets various attributes for the homepage view, including a list of product categories, the page title, login status, and the store icon. These attributes are fetched using load-balanced REST operations from backend services. Finally, it forwards the request to the "index.jsp" page for rendering. The servlet extends `AbstractUIServlet` and includes cookie checking functionality.
