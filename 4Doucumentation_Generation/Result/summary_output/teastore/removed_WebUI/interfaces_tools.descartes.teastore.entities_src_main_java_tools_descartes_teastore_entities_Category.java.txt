This code defines a `Category` entity class with basic properties (id, name, description) and standard methods. It includes constructors (default and copy), getters/setters, and overrides for `equals()` and `hashCode()` (based on id). The class serves as a data model for product categories, with the id being the primary identifier. The copy constructor and REST-specific setId() method suggest it's designed for use in a web application with persistence.
