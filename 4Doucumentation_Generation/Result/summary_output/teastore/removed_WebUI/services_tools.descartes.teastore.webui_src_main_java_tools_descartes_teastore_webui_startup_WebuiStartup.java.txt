This code initializes and manages a web UI service in a microservices architecture. It registers the service with a registry client on startup (`contextInitialized`) and unregisters it on shutdown (`contextDestroyed`). It also sets up OpenTracing for distributed tracing and pre-initializes load balancers for dependent services (Auth, Image, Persistence, Recommender). The class acts as a ServletContextListener to handle lifecycle events.
