This servlet (`/reset` endpoint) resets logging functionality by: 
1. Stopping the log file writer
2. Clearing in-memory log storage 
3. Deleting all Kieker log files from the specified directory
4. Restarting the log file writer. 
It includes helper methods to recursively delete folders/files with a given prefix or entire directories. The reset allows for clean log management in the TeaStore application.
