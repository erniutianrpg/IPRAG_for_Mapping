This code provides a static method `getRecommendations` that queries a recommender service for product suggestions based on a user's order items and ID. It uses a load balancer to distribute requests, handles HTTP responses, and returns a list of recommended product IDs. If the request fails (status code â‰¥400) or times out, it throws exceptions or returns an empty list. The class encapsulates REST calls to the recommender service.
