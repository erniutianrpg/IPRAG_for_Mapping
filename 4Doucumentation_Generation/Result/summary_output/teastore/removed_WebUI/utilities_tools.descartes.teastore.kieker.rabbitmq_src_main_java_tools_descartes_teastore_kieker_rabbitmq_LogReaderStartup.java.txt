This code implements a `ServletContextListener` that starts and manages two background daemons (`LogReaderDaemon` and `FileWriterDaemon`) when a web application initializes. The daemons run in separate scheduled threads with a 10-second delay. On application shutdown, it gracefully terminates these threads. The class also provides static methods to manually start/stop the file writer daemon. Basic Log4j configuration is initialized during startup. The functionality appears to be part of a monitoring/logging system using RabbitMQ.
