The `LoginActionServlet` handles user login and logout functionality. For POST requests, it validates user credentials via `LoadBalancedStoreOperations.login()`, redirecting to the cart or homepage on success, or back to login on failure. It also processes logout requests by invalidating the session. GET requests are redirected to the homepage. The servlet manages session data using `SessionBlob` and provides appropriate feedback messages.
