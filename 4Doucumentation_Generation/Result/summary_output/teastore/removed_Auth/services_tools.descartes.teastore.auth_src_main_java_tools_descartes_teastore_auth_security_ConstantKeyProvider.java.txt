The `ConstantKeyProvider` class implements the `IKeyProvider` interface and provides a constant, hardcoded encryption key ("thebestsecretkey") for testing purposes. It warns against using this in production due to security risks, as it always returns the same key regardless of the input `SessionBlob`. This is purely for demonstration/testing scenarios.
