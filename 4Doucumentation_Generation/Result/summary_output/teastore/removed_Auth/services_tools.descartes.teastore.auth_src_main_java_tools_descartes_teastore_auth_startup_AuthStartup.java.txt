This code implements a servlet context listener for an authentication service. On startup, it initializes OpenTracing for monitoring, sets a REST client timeout, pre-initializes load balancers for the persistence service, and registers with a service registry. On shutdown, it unregisters from the registry. The class facilitates service discovery and distributed tracing in a microservices architecture.
