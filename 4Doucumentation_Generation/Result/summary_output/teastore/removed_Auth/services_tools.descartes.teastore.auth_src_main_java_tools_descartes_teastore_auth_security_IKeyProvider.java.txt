The `IKeyProvider` interface defines a contract for providing consistent security keys across distributed instances of a system. It declares a single method `getKey(SessionBlob blob)` that returns a key for securing session data, ensuring the same key is generated regardless of which system instance processes the request. This enables secure, replicated session handling in distributed environments.
