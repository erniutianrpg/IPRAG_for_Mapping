The `LogReaderDaemon` class implements a RabbitMQ log reader daemon that continuously retrieves Kieker monitoring logs from a specified AMQP queue (`kieker`). It configures and initializes an AMQP reader with a binary deserializer, connects it to a log consumer, and runs the analysis controller to process incoming logs. If interrupted, it gracefully terminates the controller. The daemon connects to `amqp://admin:nimda@127.0.0.1` by default.
