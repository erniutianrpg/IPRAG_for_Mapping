The `Category` class is a simple entity representing a product category with an ID, name, and description. It includes constructors (default and copy), getters/setters for all fields, and overrides for `equals()` and `hashCode()` (based on ID). The class is designed for REST API use, with the ID setter marked as persistence-ignored. The entity follows standard Java bean conventions and includes proper encapsulation.
