This servlet (`/reset`) handles log reset functionality. When accessed via GET, it: 
1. Stops the log file writer
2. Clears in-memory log storage 
3. Deletes all log files with "kieker" prefix from the Tomcat logs directory
4. Restarts the file writer
It includes helper methods to recursively delete folders/files. Essentially, it provides a way to clean up and reset logging systems.
