The `ShaSecurityProvider` class implements security using SHA-512 hashing. It provides methods to secure and validate a `SessionBlob` object by generating and checking a SHA-512 hash token. The `secure` method creates a token from the blob's JSON string representation, while `validate` checks if the stored token matches a newly generated hash. A constant key is used as salt. If validation fails, it returns `null`. The class handles JSON serialization and URL encoding for the blob.
