This code provides non-load-balanced CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for interacting with RESTful services. It includes methods for sending entities for creation/updates, deleting entities, and retrieving single or multiple entities (with optional filtering/pagination). The operations handle HTTP responses, throwing exceptions for timeouts (408) or not found (404) errors. It uses JAX-RS WebTarget for HTTP requests and supports JSON media type. The class is designed as a utility with static methods and no instantiation.
