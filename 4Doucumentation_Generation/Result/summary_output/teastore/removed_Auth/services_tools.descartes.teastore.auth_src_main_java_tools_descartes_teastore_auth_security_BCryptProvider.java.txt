The `BCryptProvider` class is a utility wrapper for the BCrypt password hashing function. It provides a single static method `checkPassword` that compares a plaintext password against a BCrypt-hashed password, returning `true` if they match. The class prevents instantiation with a private constructor. This simplifies secure password validation using BCrypt's built-in checking mechanism.
