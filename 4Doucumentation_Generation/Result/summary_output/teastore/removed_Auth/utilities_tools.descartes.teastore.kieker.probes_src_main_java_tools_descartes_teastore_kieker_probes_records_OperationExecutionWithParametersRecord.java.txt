This code defines a `OperationExecutionWithParametersRecord` class that extends `OperationExecutionRecord` from the Kieker monitoring framework. It adds functionality to store method execution details including parameter types/values and return type/value. The class provides serialization/deserialization methods, getters for stored data, and an equality check. It's used for enhanced monitoring of method executions with payload characterization in a distributed system.
