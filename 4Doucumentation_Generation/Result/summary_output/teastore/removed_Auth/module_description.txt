This module forms the core infrastructure for a distributed e-commerce system (TeaStore), providing essential services including authentication, session management, entity modeling, monitoring, and logging. It implements a microservices architecture with RESTful endpoints for user authentication, shopping cart operations, and order processing, secured through cryptographic providers and session validation. The module includes comprehensive entity classes (Products, Orders, Users) for data modeling, along with utilities for distributed logging via RabbitMQ/Kieker, container memory configuration, and service registry integration. Monitoring aspects track system performance while maintaining security through consistent key providers and hashing mechanisms across distributed instances.
