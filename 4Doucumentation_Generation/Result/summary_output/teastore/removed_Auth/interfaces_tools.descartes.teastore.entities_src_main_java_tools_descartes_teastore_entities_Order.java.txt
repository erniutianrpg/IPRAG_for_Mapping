The `Order` class is a Java entity representing an e-commerce order. It stores order details including ID, user ID, timestamp, total price, shipping address (name, line 1, line 2), and credit card information (company, number, expiry date). The class provides getters/setters for all fields, a copy constructor, and overrides `equals()` and `hashCode()` based on ID and user ID. It's designed for REST API use with persistence considerations.
