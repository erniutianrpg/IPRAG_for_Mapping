The `ISessionIdGenerator` interface defines a single method `getSessionId()` that generates and returns a unique session ID string. It serves as a contract for implementing classes to provide session ID generation functionality, typically used for authentication or session management in web applications. The interface is minimal, focusing solely on the ID generation capability.
