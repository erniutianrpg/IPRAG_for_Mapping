This servlet acts as a simple web interface for accessing Kieker monitoring logs. When accessed via GET request (`/index`), it returns an HTML page with three links: 1) to download log files, 2) to view logs stored in memory, and 3) to reset logs. It serves as a navigation page for log management functionality.
