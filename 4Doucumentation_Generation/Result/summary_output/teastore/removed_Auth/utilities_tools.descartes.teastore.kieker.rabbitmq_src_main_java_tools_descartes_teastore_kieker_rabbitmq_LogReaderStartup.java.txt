This code implements a `ServletContextListener` that starts and stops two background daemons (LogReaderDaemon and FileWriterDaemon) for a RabbitMQ logging system. On web app startup, it initializes scheduled executors to run these daemons after a 10-second delay. On shutdown, it gracefully terminates these services. The FileWriterDaemon writes logs to files, while the LogReaderDaemon presumably reads logs from RabbitMQ. Basic Log4j configuration is also set up during initialization.
