This code implements a REST API for managing a shopping cart. It provides three endpoints:  
1. `add/{pid}` - Adds a product to the cart or increments its quantity if already present.  
2. `remove/{pid}` - Removes a product from the cart.  
3. `{pid}` - Updates the quantity of a product in the cart.  

All operations work with a `SessionBlob` (containing cart items) and return it secured via `ShaSecurityProvider`. Errors return appropriate HTTP status codes (404, 408). The cart stores products as `OrderItem` objects with product IDs, quantities, and prices.
