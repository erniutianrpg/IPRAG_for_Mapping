The `ContentSelectorViewModel` class manages content selectors (field-value pairs) for a BibTeX database in JabRef. It handles adding/removing fields (like author, journal) and their associated keywords, maintains a map of field-keyword pairs, and synchronizes with the database metadata. It provides JavaFX properties for UI binding and dialog services for user interactions. The class ensures unique fields/keywords and persists changes to the database metadata.
