The `CopyFilesAction` class is a command that copies files linked to selected BibTeX entries to a user-specified directory. It checks for an active database and selected entries, prompts the user to choose a destination folder, then executes a background task (`CopyFilesTask`) to perform the copy operation. Progress is shown during the operation, and results are displayed in a dialog upon completion, including a message if no linked files are found. The action is only executable when a database is open and entries are selected.
