This code provides utility methods for working with OpenOffice/LibreOffice UNO (Universal Network Objects) properties. It includes functions to: 
1. Convert property containers to property sets
2. Retrieve property set information and names 
3. Get property values as objects 
4. Handle property-related exceptions 

The methods work with `XPropertySet`, `XPropertyContainer`, and `XPropertySetInfo` interfaces, offering null-safe operations through `Optional` and streamlined property name extraction via streams. The utilities simplify common property operations in UNO-based document automation.
