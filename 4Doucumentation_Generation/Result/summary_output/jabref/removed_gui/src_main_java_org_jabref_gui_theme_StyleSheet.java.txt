This code defines an abstract `StyleSheet` class for managing CSS stylesheets in a Java application. It provides methods to get stylesheet URLs for JavaFX scenes and web engines, watch for file changes, and reload styles. The `create` method attempts to load a stylesheet from either a classpath resource or a file path, handling errors gracefully. It returns different `StyleSheet` implementations (`StyleSheetFile`, `StyleSheetResource`, or `StyleSheetDataUrl`) based on the source. The class supports both file-based and resource-based stylesheets with proper error logging.
