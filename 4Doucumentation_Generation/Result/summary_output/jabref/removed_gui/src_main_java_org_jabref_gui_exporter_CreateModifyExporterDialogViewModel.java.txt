This code defines a ViewModel class `CreateModifyExporterDialogViewModel` for managing the creation or modification of custom exporters in JabRef. It handles UI properties (name, layout file, extension), validates input, and saves exporter configurations. The class includes methods to browse for layout files and save exporter details, creating a `TemplateExporter` with the specified parameters. It interacts with preferences and dialog services for file selection and directory management.
