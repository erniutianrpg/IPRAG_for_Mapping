The `ParserResultWarningDialog` class displays warning messages from file imports or openings in JabRef. It checks for warnings in a `ParserResult` object and, if present, formats them into a numbered list. The dialog's title includes the filename if available. The warnings are shown in a warning dialog via `JabRefFrame`. Optionally, it can switch to a specific database tab before displaying the warnings. The class contains two static methods with different parameters for flexibility.
