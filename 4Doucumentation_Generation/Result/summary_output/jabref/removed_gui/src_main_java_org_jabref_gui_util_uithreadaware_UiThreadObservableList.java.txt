The `UiThreadObservableList` class wraps an `ObservableList` to ensure all list change and invalidation listeners are notified on the JavaFX Application Thread. This is crucial for UI updates in JavaFX, which must occur on the UI thread. The class delegates all list operations to the wrapped list but intercepts listener registrations to wrap them with thread-aware variants (`UiThreadListChangeListener` and `UiThreadInvalidationListener`). This enables safe UI updates when the list is modified from background threads.
