The `ThreeWayMergeCellViewModel` class manages the view state for a three-way merge cell in a JavaFX UI. It stores text content and tracks whether the cell is in an odd or even row (for styling purposes). The constructor initializes these properties based on the row index, ensuring odd/even states are mutually exclusive through EasyBind subscriptions. It provides getters, setters, and property accessors for text and row parity (odd/even). Header rows are exempt from odd/even styling.
