The `OtherFieldsTab` class in JabRef is an entry editor tab that displays non-standard fields of a BibTeX entry. It shows fields not defined in the entry type's required/optional fields, excluding deprecated fields, key fields, and custom tab fields. The tab is labeled "Other fields" and helps users manage additional metadata fields beyond the standard ones for a given bibliography entry type. The fields to display are determined by comparing the entry's fields against known fields from its type definition.
