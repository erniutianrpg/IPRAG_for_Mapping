The `HeaderCell` class is a read-only JavaFX cell used to display headers in a ThreeWayMerge UI. It extends `ThreeWayMergeCell` and contains a `Label` that binds to a text property. The cell applies a default style class and custom padding to the label. Its main purpose is to visually present header text in a consistent, styled manner within the merge interface.
