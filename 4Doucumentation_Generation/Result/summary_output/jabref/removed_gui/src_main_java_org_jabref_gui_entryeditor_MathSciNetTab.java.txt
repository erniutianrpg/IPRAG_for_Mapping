The `MathSciNetTab` class is an entry editor tab in JabRef that displays MathSciNet reviews for BibTeX entries. It checks if an entry has a MathSciNet ID (MR number) and, if present, loads the corresponding review webpage in a WebView. The tab shows a progress indicator during loading and hides it when 70% loaded. It disables navigation and context menus in the WebView. The tab only appears for entries with valid MathSciNet IDs.
