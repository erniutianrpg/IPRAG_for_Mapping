The `ImporterViewModel` class acts as a view model for a custom importer in JabRef, wrapping a `CustomImporter` instance. It exposes the importer's name, class name, and base path as observable JavaFX `StringProperty` objects for UI binding. The class provides getter methods for these properties and a method (`getLogic()`) to access the underlying `CustomImporter` logic. Essentially, it bridges the importer's data to the GUI layer.
