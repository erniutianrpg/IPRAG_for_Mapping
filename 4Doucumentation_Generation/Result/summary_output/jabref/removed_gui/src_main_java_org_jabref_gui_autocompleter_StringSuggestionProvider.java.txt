The `StringSuggestionProvider` abstract class extends `SuggestionProvider<String>` to provide string-based autocompletion suggestions. It defines:  
1. Equality comparison using `Equivalence.equals()`  
2. Natural ordering for sorting suggestions  
3. Case-insensitive matching between input and candidates  
4. An abstract method `getSource()` to fetch suggestion strings  
This class serves as a base for providers that offer string autocompletion, handling comparison and matching logic while delegating data sourcing to subclasses. (98 words)
