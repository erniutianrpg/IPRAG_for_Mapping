This JavaFX dialog class `ExtractBibtexDialog` provides a GUI for extracting BibTeX entries from plain text. It features a text area for input and a parse button. When clicked, the button triggers parsing via a ViewModel (`BibtexExtractorViewModel`), which processes the text (split by double empty lines) and adds valid entries to the current database. The button is disabled when the input is empty. The dialog uses dependency injection for services like database management, preferences, and undo operations.
