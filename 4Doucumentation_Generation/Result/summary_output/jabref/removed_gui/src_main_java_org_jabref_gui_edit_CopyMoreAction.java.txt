The `CopyMoreAction` class handles various copy operations for BibTeX entries in JabRef, including copying titles, citation keys, DOIs, and combinations like key-title or key-link pairs. It checks for selected entries, processes the requested data, copies it to the clipboard, and provides user feedback via notifications. The class supports different copy formats (plain text, HTML) and handles cases where data might be missing.
