This code defines an abstract `OptionEditorViewModel` class for managing option-based field editors in JabRef. It extends `AbstractEditorViewModel` and provides methods for converting between display text and model objects (`getStringConverter`, `convertToDisplayText`), and accessing available options (`getItems`). The class serves as a base for editors that need to display and manage a set of selectable options, such as dropdown menus or autocomplete fields. It requires implementing these conversion and item-providing methods for specific data types.
