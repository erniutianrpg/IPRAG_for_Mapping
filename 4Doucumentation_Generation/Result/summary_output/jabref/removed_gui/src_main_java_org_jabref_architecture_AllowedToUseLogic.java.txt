This code defines a custom annotation `@AllowedToUseLogic` in Java, which serves as a marker to indicate that a particular logic class is permitted to be used within the model package. The annotation includes a mandatory `value()` field to provide a rationale explaining why the class is allowed this access. This is likely used for architectural enforcement or documentation purposes.
