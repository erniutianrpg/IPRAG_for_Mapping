The `CopyCitationAction` class copies selected BibTeX entries to the clipboard in a formatted citation style or custom preview layout. It supports HTML, plain text, and other output formats. The action generates citations using either a predefined citation style or a custom layout, processes them into clipboard-friendly formats, and notifies the user upon completion. The class relies on background tasks for performance and handles errors gracefully.
