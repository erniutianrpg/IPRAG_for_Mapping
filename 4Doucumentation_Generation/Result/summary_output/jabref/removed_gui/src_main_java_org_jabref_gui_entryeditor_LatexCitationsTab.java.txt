The `LatexCitationsTab` class is a JavaFX-based UI component for JabRef that displays LaTeX citations for a given BibTeX entry. It provides a tab interface with: 1) a search pane showing citation results, progress indicators, or error messages; 2) functionality to set LaTeX file directories; and 3) dynamic display of citations found in LaTeX files. The tab updates based on search status (in progress, found, no results, or error) and binds to the current BibTeX entry. It uses a view model (`LatexCitationsTabViewModel`) to handle the business logic.
