This code defines an `ApplicationInsightsLogEvent` class that adapts a tinylog `LogEntry` into Microsoft Application Insights' telemetry format. It converts log entries with their metadata (message, exception, severity level, thread info, timestamp) into a structure compatible with Application Insights, including custom parameters and normalized severity levels. The class serves as a bridge between tinylog logging and Application Insights telemetry.
