This code provides utility methods for working with XML documents in Java. Key functionalities include:
1. Printing XML documents to standard output for debugging (`printDocument`)
2. Converting `NodeList` to a `List` for easier iteration (`asList`)
3. Extracting content from specific nodes (`getNodeContent`) or attributes (`getAttributeContent`)
4. Finding nodes by name (`getNodesByName`, `getNode`)
5. Includes a helper class (`NodeListWrapper`) to make `NodeList` iterable

The class is primarily used for debugging and XML manipulation tasks in the JabRef application.
