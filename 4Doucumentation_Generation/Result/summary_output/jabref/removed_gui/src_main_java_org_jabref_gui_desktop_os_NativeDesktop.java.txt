The `NativeDesktop` interface defines methods for OS-specific desktop operations, including opening files/folders, launching applications, detecting program paths, and accessing system directories (applications, user home, and default file chooser). It provides platform-agnostic abstractions for file operations, console access, and directory queries, with some default implementations like `getUserDirectory()`. Methods may throw `IOException` for file-related errors.
