This Java class `BibTexStringChange` represents a modification to a `BibtexString` (a string entry in a BibTeX database). It tracks changes between old and new string versions, provides methods to apply these changes, and supports undo functionality via `UndoableStringChange`. The class extends `DatabaseChange` to integrate with JabRef's database change tracking system, labeling the change as "Modified string" with the string's name. The `applyChange` method updates the string content and records the change for undo operations.
