This JavaFX dialog displays LaTeX citation search results. It shows a list of references (in a `ListView`) and their corresponding citations (in a `CitationsDisplay` panel). Users can select references to view associated citations and import them via an import button. The dialog uses a view-model (`ParseLatexResultViewModel`) to manage data, binding UI elements to the model. Highlighted references are shown in accent color. The dialog title is localized, and font styles follow the application theme. The import button is disabled when no references are selected.
