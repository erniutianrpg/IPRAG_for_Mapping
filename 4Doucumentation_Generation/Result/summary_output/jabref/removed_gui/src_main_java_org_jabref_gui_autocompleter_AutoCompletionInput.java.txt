The `AutoCompletionInput` class stores and provides access to two string components used in auto-completion: a `prefix` (likely representing the beginning of a word/phrase) and an `unfinishedPart` (the incomplete portion being typed). It offers getter methods to retrieve these components but doesn't modify them. This simple data structure facilitates auto-completion functionality by maintaining the input state. (49 words)
