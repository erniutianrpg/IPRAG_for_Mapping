This code defines a `BibTexStringAdd` class that represents the addition of a new string (`BibtexString`) to a BibTeX database. It extends `DatabaseChange` to handle the change, provides a localized description, and implements `applyChange` to add the string to the database while supporting undo operations via `NamedCompound`. If the string key already exists (`KeyCollisionException`), it logs a warning. The class also includes a getter for the added string.
