The `RequiredFieldsTab` class is an entry editor tab in JabRef that displays required fields for a BibEntry based on its type. It extends `FieldsEditorTab` and overrides `determineFieldsToShow()` to fetch required fields from the entry's type using `BibEntryTypesManager`. If the entry type is unknown, it shows all fields. The tab includes the Bibtex key field by default and is labeled "Required fields" with a tooltip and icon. It initializes with various dependencies for database operations, UI, and preferences.
