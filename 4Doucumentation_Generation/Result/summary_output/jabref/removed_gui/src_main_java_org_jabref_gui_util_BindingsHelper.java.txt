This JavaFX utility class provides helper methods for creating and managing bindings between observable properties, lists, and maps. Key functionalities include:

1. Managing bidirectional bindings between properties with value conversion
2. Mapping observable values to observable lists
3. Handling UI pseudo-class states based on conditions
4. Creating constant observable values
5. Thread-safe UI list operations
6. Conditional value bindings (if-then-else)
7. Future subscription to observable changes

The class prevents infinite update loops during bidirectional binding and provides type-safe binding operations for various JavaFX observable types.
