This JavaFX class `PushToVimSettings` extends `PushToApplicationSettings` to provide configuration options for pushing references to Vim. It adds a text field for specifying the Vim server name, initializes it with a preference value, and saves the entered value back to preferences when settings are stored. The UI includes a labeled input field positioned in a grid layout. The class integrates with JabRef's preference system and localization. (98 words)
