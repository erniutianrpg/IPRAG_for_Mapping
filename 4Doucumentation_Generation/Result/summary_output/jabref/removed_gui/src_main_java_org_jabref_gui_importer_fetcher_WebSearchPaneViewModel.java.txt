This code defines a `WebSearchPaneViewModel` class for JabRef's GUI that handles web-based literature searches. It manages: 
1. A list of available search fetchers (like Google Scholar)
2. The currently selected fetcher
3. Search query input with validation
4. Executing searches via the selected fetcher
5. Displaying results in a dialog
6. Persisting user preferences for the last-used fetcher. The class uses JavaFX properties for data binding and includes query syntax validation.
