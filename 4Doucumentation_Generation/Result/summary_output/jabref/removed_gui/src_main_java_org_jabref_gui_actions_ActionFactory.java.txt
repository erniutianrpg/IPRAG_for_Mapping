The `ActionFactory` class is a helper utility that creates and configures JavaFX UI controls (menus, buttons, etc.) based on `Action` objects. It handles:
1. Creating and styling menu items, checkboxes, menus, and buttons
2. Binding actions to commands with keyboard shortcuts
3. Setting icons and tooltips
4. Fixing graphic display issues in controls
5. Supporting both regular and icon buttons with custom styling

The class uses reflection to access internal JavaFX components for proper menu item configuration and integrates with JabRef's key binding system.
