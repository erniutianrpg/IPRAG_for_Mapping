The `FileDownloadTask` class downloads a file from a given URL to a specified local path. It extends `BackgroundTask` to perform the download asynchronously. During the download, it tracks progress using `ProgressInputStream` and updates the progress property. It ensures the destination directory exists before copying the file, replacing any existing file with the same name. The task returns the destination path upon completion.
