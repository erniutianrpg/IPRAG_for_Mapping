The `ThreeWayMergeHeaderView` class creates a three-column header for a merge interface using JavaFX's `GridPane`. It displays left, right, and merged entry headers with equal width columns. The class provides methods to update left/right header texts and includes styling adjustments to align with a scrollable content area. The header ensures consistent column widths, unlike `HBox` which varies widths based on text length.
