The `AbstractViewModel` class is an empty abstract base class in the `org.jabref.gui` package, likely serving as a foundation for ViewModel classes in a Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture. It provides no functionality itself but may be extended by other ViewModels to ensure consistency or to share common behavior in the future.
