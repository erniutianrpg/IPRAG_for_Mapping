This code compares two BibTeX databases (`originalDatabase` and `otherDatabase`) and generates a list of changes needed to transform the original into the other. It detects differences in metadata, groups, preamble, BibTeX strings (additions, deletions, changes, renames), and entries (additions, deletions, modifications). The changes are returned as an unmodifiable list of `DatabaseChange` objects, each representing a specific type of modification. The class uses a factory (`DatabaseChangeResolverFactory`) to resolve changes.
