The `ShowDocumentViewerAction` class is a command in JabRef that opens a document viewer dialog. It's executable only when entries are selected and have associated files (checked via `needsEntriesSelected` and `isFilePresentForSelectedEntry`). When executed, it instantiates a `DialogService` and displays a custom `DocumentViewerView` dialog. This action is part of JabRef's GUI for viewing documents linked to bibliographic entries.
