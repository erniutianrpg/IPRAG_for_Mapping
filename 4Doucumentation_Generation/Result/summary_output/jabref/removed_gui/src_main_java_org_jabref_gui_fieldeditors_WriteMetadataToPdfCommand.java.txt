This code defines a command `WriteMetadataToPdfCommand` that writes bibliographic metadata from a `BibEntry` to a linked PDF file. It uses XMP metadata and embedded BibTeX data, handling the process in a background task. The command checks if the file exists, writes metadata using `XmpUtilWriter` and `EmbeddedBibFilePdfExporter`, and notifies the user of success or failure. It's part of the JabRef application for managing bibliographic data.
