This JavaFX dialog allows users to create or modify export formats in JabRef. It provides fields for name, filename, and extension, bound to a view model. The dialog saves the exporter when the "save" button is clicked and includes a browse functionality for file selection. It uses dependency injection for services like preferences and journal abbreviations. The dialog's result is converted to an `ExporterViewModel` upon saving.
