This code defines an abstract `EntryEditorTab` class (extending JavaFX's `Tab`) for managing BibTeX entry editor tabs in JabRef. It tracks the current BibEntry and its type, provides methods to determine tab visibility (`shouldShow`), update entry content (`bindToEntry`), handle focus events (`handleFocus`, `notifyAboutFocus`), and switch preview styles (`nextPreviewStyle`, `previousPreviewStyle`). The tab automatically updates when the entry or its type changes. Concrete implementations must define tab-specific display logic.
