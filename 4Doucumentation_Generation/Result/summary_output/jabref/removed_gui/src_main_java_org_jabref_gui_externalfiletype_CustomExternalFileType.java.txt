The `CustomExternalFileType` class defines a type of external file that can be linked in JabRef, storing metadata like name, extension, MIME type, default application, and icon. It provides constructors to create file types from parameters or another file type, a static method to build from a string array (for preferences), and getter/setter methods for all properties. The class also includes equality checks, copying, and hashing functionality. Icons default to a standard file icon if unspecified.
