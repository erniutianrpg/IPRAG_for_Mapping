The `ClipBoardManager` class provides clipboard functionality for both system and primary (X11) clipboards. It allows: 
- Getting/setting text content from/to both clipboards
- Adding X11 support for middle-click paste in text controls
- Handling HTML content with plain text fallback
- Serializing BibTeX entries to clipboard
- Managing clipboard operations across AWT and JavaFX platforms

The class serves as a unified interface for clipboard operations in a JabRef application, supporting both basic text and specialized BibTeX entry transfers.
