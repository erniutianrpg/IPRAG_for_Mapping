The `ImportHandler` class in JabRef manages the import of external files (PDFs, BibTeX) and data (DOIs, arXiv IDs) into a bibliography database. It handles file processing in the background, creates new entries with file links, checks for duplicates, generates citation keys, and adds entries to groups. It also supports fetching metadata from DOIs and arXiv IDs, and provides undo functionality for imports. The class integrates with JabRef's UI and preferences system for a seamless user experience.
