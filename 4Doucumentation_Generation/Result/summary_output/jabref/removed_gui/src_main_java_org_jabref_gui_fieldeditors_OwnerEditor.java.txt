The `OwnerEditor` class is a JavaFX-based field editor for the "owner" field in JabRef, a reference management software. It extends `HBox` and implements `FieldEditorFX`. The editor binds to a BibTeX entry, provides text editing with validation, includes a context menu, and offers autocompletion via `SuggestionProvider`. It uses a view model (`OwnerEditorViewModel`) to manage data and validation, and allows setting the current user as the owner via the `setOwner()` method. The editor integrates with JabRef's preferences and field validation system.
