The `SpecialFieldValueViewModel` class acts as a bridge between `SpecialFieldValue` enum values and their UI representations in JabRef. It provides methods to:
1. Get the associated icon (`getIcon`)
2. Get localized menu text (`getMenuString`)
3. Get tooltip text (`getToolTipText`)
4. Get corresponding actions (`getAction`)

The class handles various special field values like priority levels, read statuses, quality marks, and ranks, converting them into appropriate UI elements with localized strings. It essentially maps backend field values to frontend display components.
