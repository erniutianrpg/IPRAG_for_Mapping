The `DirectoryDialogConfiguration` class helps configure a directory dialog by managing an initial directory path. It uses a builder pattern to set the initial directory, converting it to an absolute path and ensuring it's a valid, existing directory (or its parent if a file is provided). If the path doesn't exist, it sets it to `null`. The `getInitialDirectory()` method returns the path as an `Optional`. This simplifies dialog setup while handling path validation and conversion.
