The `InfoButton` class creates a non-clickable JavaFX button that displays an information icon and a customizable message. It uses `ActionFactory` to configure the button's appearance with an icon from `IconTheme` and binds the button's text to a `StringProperty` (`infoMessage`). The button is set to be non-focusable and maximized in height. Although it inherits from `Button`, it's designed to be informational only, with an empty `execute()` method preventing any action on click.
