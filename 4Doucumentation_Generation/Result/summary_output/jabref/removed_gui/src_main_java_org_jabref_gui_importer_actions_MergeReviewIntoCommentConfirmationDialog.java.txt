This code displays a confirmation dialog asking users whether to merge deprecated 'Review' fields into 'Comment' fields for given BibTeX entries. It lists affected entries by their citation keys, explains the merge reason (JabRef 4.2 deprecation), and returns the user's choice (true/false) via `DialogService`. The dialog is shown when entries have both fields, prompting for merge approval.
