The `UndoableInsertEntries` class implements undo/redo functionality for inserting BibTeX entries into a database in JabRef. It tracks inserted entries and whether they came from a paste operation. The `undo()` method removes the entries, while `redo()` reinserts them. The class also provides localized presentation names for the undo action (e.g., "insert entry" or "paste entries"). It handles both single and multiple entries, displaying entry citation keys when available.
