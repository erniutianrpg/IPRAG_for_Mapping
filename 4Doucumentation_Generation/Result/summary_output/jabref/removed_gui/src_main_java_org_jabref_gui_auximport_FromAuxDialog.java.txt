This JavaFX dialog enables users to import references from a TeX AUX file into JabRef. The dialog allows browsing for an AUX file, parses it to extract citations, and displays unresolved keys and parsing status. If valid references are found, users can generate a new database tab with them. Key features include file browsing, parsing validation, and feedback on missing citations. The dialog integrates with JabRef's main UI and preferences.
