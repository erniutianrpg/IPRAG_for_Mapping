The `UndoableStringChange` class implements undo/redo functionality for changes to a `BibtexString` object's name or content. It stores the old and new values, and whether the change was a name change. The `undo()` method reverts to the old value, while `redo()` reapplies the new value. The `getPresentationName()` method provides a localized description of the change. This class extends `AbstractUndoableJabRefEdit` to integrate with JabRef's undo system. (98 words)
