This code defines an enum `KeyBinding` that represents various keyboard shortcuts for the JabRef application. Each enum constant includes a name, localized description, default key combination, and category (e.g., EDITOR, FILE, SEARCH). The enum provides methods to access these properties, enabling consistent management of keyboard shortcuts across the application. The shortcuts cover editor navigation, file operations, entry management, and other common actions.
