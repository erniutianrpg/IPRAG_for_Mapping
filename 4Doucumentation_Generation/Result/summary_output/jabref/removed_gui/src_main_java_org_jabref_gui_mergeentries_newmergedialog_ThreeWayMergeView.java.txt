The `ThreeWayMergeView` class provides a JavaFX-based UI for merging two BibTeX entries (`BibEntry`). It displays fields from left and right entries side-by-side, allowing users to select values for the merged entry. The view includes a toolbar for actions like showing differences, highlighting changes, and hiding equal fields. It supports special handling for fields like person names and groups. The merged result can be accessed via `getMergedEntry()`. The layout is scrollable and responsive, with configurable column constraints and diff display options.
