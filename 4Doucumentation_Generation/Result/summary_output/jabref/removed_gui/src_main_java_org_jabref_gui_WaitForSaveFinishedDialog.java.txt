This code displays a progress dialog when an application is closing but needs to wait for ongoing save operations to complete. It checks if any `LibraryTab` is still saving, and if so, shows a dialog with a progress bar while periodically checking (every 100ms) until all saves finish. The dialog shows a "Please wait..." message until the operations complete or are cancelled.
