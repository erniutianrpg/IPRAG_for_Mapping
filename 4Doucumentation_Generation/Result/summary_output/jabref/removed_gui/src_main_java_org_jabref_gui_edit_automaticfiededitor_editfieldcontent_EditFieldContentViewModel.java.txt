1. Clear, set, or append values to a selected field across multiple entries
2. Validate field names (no whitespace/empty)
3. Track changes for undo/redo operations
4. Manage UI state (selected field, value, overwrite flag)
5. Update the application state with edit results

The class handles batch operations on selected entries while maintaining undo history and field validation.
