The `UnlinkedFilesDialogViewModel` class manages a dialog for finding, importing, and exporting unlinked files in JabRef. It provides functionality to:
1. Search for unlinked files in a directory with filters (file type, date range, sorting)
2. Import selected files into the database
3. Export a list of selected files to a text file
4. Track progress and validate directory paths
5. Manage file filters and sorting options

The class uses JavaFX properties for UI binding and background tasks for file operations.
