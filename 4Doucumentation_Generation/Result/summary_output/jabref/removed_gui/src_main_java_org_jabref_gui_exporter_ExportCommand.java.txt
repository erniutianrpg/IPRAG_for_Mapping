The `ExportCommand` class handles export functionality in JabRef, allowing users to export either all entries or selected entries from a bibliography database. It presents a file save dialog with supported export formats, processes the user's selection, and exports the entries to the specified file. The command supports background execution, success notifications with an option to reveal the exported file, and error handling with user notifications. It also remembers the last used export settings for future exports.
