This JavaFX code from JabRef exports bibliographic metadata to PDF files. It provides a GUI dialog to write XMP data and embed BibTeX entries into PDFs linked from selected database entries. The action checks for valid entries and PDFs, tracks progress (successes, skips, errors), and allows cancellation. It uses background tasks for processing and shows real-time progress in a text area. The `OptionsDialog` class manages the UI for progress display and user interaction.
