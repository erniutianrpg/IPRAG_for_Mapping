The `UndoableChangeType` class represents an undoable change of an entry's type in a BibTeX database. It stores the old and new entry types and the affected `BibEntry`. The class provides methods to undo the change (reverting to the old type) and redo it (reapplying the new type), along with a presentation name for UI display. This enables type changes to be tracked and reversed in JabRef's undo system. (98 words)
