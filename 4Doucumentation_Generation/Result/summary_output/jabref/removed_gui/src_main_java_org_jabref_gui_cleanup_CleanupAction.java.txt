The `CleanupAction` class implements a command to clean up selected BibTeX entries in JabRef. It shows a dialog for cleanup preferences, performs field formatting and PDF renaming (with undo support), and displays results. Key steps include validating selections, confirming PDF renaming, applying cleanup jobs, tracking changes, and notifying users about modified entries. The cleanup is executed as a background task to avoid UI freezing.
