The `DocumentPageViewModel` abstract class defines a view model for document pages in a viewer. It provides three abstract methods: `render()` to generate an image of the page at specified dimensions, `getPageNumber()` to retrieve the page number, and `getAspectRatio()` to calculate the page's width-to-height ratio. This serves as a base for implementing document page rendering functionality. (58 words)
