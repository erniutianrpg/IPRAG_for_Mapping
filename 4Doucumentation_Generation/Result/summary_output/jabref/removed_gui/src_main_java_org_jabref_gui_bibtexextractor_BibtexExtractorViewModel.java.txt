The `BibtexExtractorViewModel` class handles text parsing to generate BibTeX entries in JabRef. It offers two parsing methods: using a built-in BibTeX extractor or the GROBID service (if enabled). The parsed entries are imported into the database, with progress notifications and error handling. It also tracks new entries via telemetry. The class manages user input through a `StringProperty` and coordinates parsing tasks in the background.
