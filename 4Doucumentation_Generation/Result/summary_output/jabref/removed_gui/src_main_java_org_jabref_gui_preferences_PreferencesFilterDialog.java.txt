This JavaFX code defines a `PreferencesFilterDialog` class that displays and filters application preferences in a table view. The dialog shows preference options with their types, keys, values, and default values. Users can search preferences via a text field and toggle to show only preferences that deviate from default values. The table updates dynamically based on search text and the deviation toggle, with a count displaying the number of visible preferences. The dialog is part of a larger JavaFX application using the JabRef reference management system.
