The `UndoableFieldChange` class tracks and manages undo/redo operations for field value changes in a `BibEntry`. It stores the entry, field, old value, and new value. The `undo()` method reverts the field to its old value, while `redo()` reapplies the new value. It handles null values by clearing the field and provides a human-readable description of the change. This class is part of JabRef's undo functionality for bibliographic entries. (98 words)
