The `MonthEditorViewModel` class is a specialized editor for handling month fields in a bibliography database. It extends `OptionEditorViewModel` to provide month-specific functionality, including: converting between `Month` objects and their string representations (with different formats for BibLaTeX mode), parsing month strings, listing all possible months, and displaying month names. The editor supports both BibTeX and BibLaTeX database modes, showing full month names in the display while handling numeric or abbreviated formats in the background.
