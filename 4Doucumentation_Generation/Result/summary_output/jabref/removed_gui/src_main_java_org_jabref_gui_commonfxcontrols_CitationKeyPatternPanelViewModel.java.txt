This code manages citation key patterns for different entry types in a bibliography. It provides a ViewModel for a GUI panel that displays and allows editing of citation key patterns. Key features include:
- Maintaining a list of patterns for different entry types
- Handling a default pattern
- Providing methods to reset patterns to defaults
- Supporting sorting with default pattern always on top
- Using JavaFX properties for data binding with the UI

The class works with `BibEntryType` objects and `CitationKeyPatternPreferences` to manage and display citation key patterns.
