The `DefaultFileUpdateMonitor` class implements a file system watcher that monitors specified files for changes (creation/modification) and notifies registered `FileUpdateListener`s when changes occur. It uses Java's `WatchService` to watch parent directories of files, handles events in a background thread, and manages listener registration/deregistration. The monitor can be shut down gracefully and reports filesystem monitoring failures.
