This code defines an enum `KeyBindingCategory` that represents categories for keyboard shortcuts in JabRef. Each enum value (like FILE, EDIT, SEARCH) is associated with a localized display name (e.g., "File", "Edit") for UI purposes. The category names support internationalization and include common application sections like file operations, editing, searching, and BibTeX-specific functions. The enum provides a `getName()` method to retrieve the display name of each category.
