The `IdentifierEditor` class is a JavaFX-based editor for handling different types of bibliographic identifiers (DOI, ISBN, Eprint) in JabRef. It provides a text area for input and buttons to fetch bibliographic data or look up identifiers online. The editor binds to a BibEntry, validates input, and supports context menus. Depending on the identifier type (DOI, ISBN, etc.), it uses specific view models to handle operations like fetching data or opening external links.
