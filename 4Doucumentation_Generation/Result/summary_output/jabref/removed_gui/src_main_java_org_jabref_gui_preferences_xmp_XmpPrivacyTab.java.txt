This JavaFX code defines a preferences tab for managing XMP metadata privacy settings in JabRef. It provides a GUI with: 
- A checkbox to enable/disable XMP filtering
- A table listing filtered fields with delete functionality
- A combobox to add new fields to filter
- Validation and binding between UI components and the underlying ViewModel
- Keyboard shortcuts (Enter to add, Delete to remove fields)

The tab allows users to control which metadata fields should be filtered when exporting to XMP format.
