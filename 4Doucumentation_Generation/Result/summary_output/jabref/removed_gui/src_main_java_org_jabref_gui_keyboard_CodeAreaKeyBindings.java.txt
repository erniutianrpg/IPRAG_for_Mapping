This code defines key bindings for a text editor (CodeArea) in JavaFX. It maps keyboard events to editor actions like cursor movement (char/word/line/document navigation), text deletion, case modification (capitalize, lowercase, uppercase), and text removal (kill line/word). Each action updates the editor's content or cursor position and consumes the event to prevent default handling. The bindings are managed through a KeyBindingRepository.
