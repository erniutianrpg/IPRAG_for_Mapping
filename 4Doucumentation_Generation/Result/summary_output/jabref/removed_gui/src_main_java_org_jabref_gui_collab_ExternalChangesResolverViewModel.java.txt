This code manages external changes to a database in JabRef, a reference management software. It tracks and resolves conflicts between local and external changes through a UI. Key features include:
- Maintaining lists of visible and all changes
- Allowing users to accept, deny, or merge changes
- Tracking selected changes and resolution status
- Applying accepted changes to the database with undo support
- Using JavaFX bindings for UI synchronization

The class serves as a ViewModel in the MVVM pattern, handling change resolution logic while staying decoupled from the view.
