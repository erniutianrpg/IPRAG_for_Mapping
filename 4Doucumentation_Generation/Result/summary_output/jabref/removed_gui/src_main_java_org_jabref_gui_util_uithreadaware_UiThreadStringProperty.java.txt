The `UiThreadStringProperty` class wraps a `StringProperty` to ensure all listener notifications (for value changes or invalidations) are executed on the JavaFX Application Thread. This is crucial for UI updates in JavaFX, which must occur on the main thread. The class delegates all property operations to the wrapped `StringProperty` but wraps listeners with thread-aware variants (`UiThreadChangeListener` and `UiThreadInvalidationListener`) to enforce thread safety for UI modifications.
