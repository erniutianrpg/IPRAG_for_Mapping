This code defines an abstract `SuggestionProvider` class that generates autocomplete suggestions. It filters, sorts, and limits suggestions (to 10 items) based on user input, using custom comparators and equivalence relations for uniqueness. The class provides two main methods: `provideSuggestions()` for context-aware suggestions and `getPossibleSuggestions()` for all possible suggestions. Subclasses must implement matching logic, sorting, equivalence, and data source methods.
