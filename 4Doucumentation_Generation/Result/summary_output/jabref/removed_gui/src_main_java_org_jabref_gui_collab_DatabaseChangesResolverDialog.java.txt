This JavaFX dialog class `DatabaseChangesResolverDialog` helps users resolve conflicts between external changes and a BibTeX database. It displays a list of changes in a table, allows selecting individual changes to preview details (cached for performance), and provides buttons to accept, deny, or manually resolve changes. The dialog tracks resolution status and automatically closes when all changes are resolved. It uses a view model (`ExternalChangesResolverViewModel`) to manage change states and operations.
