The `StringManipulator` class provides text manipulation utilities for word-level operations. It can:
1. Change word casing (uppercase, lowercase, capitalize) from a given position
2. Delete words in either direction (forward or backward) from a cursor position
3. Find word boundaries in text

Key methods include `setWordCase()` for case changes, `deleteUntilWordBoundary()` for word deletion, and `getNextWordBoundary()` for navigation. The class returns both modified text and updated cursor positions. It's designed for text editing operations in JabRef's context.
