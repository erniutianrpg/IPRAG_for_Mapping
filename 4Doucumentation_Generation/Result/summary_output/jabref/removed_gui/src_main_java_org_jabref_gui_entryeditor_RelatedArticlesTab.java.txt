The `RelatedArticlesTab` class in JabRef displays article recommendations for a selected BibEntry. It fetches related articles from Mr. DLib, showing them in a scrollable pane with titles, journals, authors, and years as clickable links. If fetching fails, it displays an error message. For first-time users, it shows a privacy consent dialog to configure data-sharing preferences with Mr. DLib. The tab only appears if recommendations are enabled in preferences.
