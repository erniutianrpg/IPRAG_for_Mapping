The `DialogService` interface provides methods to create and display various JavaFX dialogs for user interaction in a JabRef GUI application. It includes methods for choice dialogs, input dialogs, information/warning/error alerts, confirmation dialogs, password dialogs, file/directory selection dialogs, progress dialogs, and print dialogs. The interface supports both blocking (wait-for-response) and non-blocking notifications, with options for custom buttons and opt-out checkboxes. It serves as a centralized service for all dialog-related UI interactions in the application.
