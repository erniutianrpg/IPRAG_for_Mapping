This code defines an enumeration `StandardExternalFileType` that represents various file types (PDF, Word, Excel, images, etc.) in the JabRef reference manager. Each file type includes metadata like name, extension, MIME type, default application to open with, and an associated icon. The class implements `ExternalFileType` interface, providing methods to access these properties. It serves as a centralized definition of supported external file types with their associated attributes for the application.
