The `StreamGobbler` class implements `Runnable` to asynchronously read lines from an `InputStream` (e.g., from an external process) and pass each line to a `Consumer<String>` for processing. It handles IO errors by logging them. This is commonly used to consume output/error streams from external processes to prevent blocking. (Words: 50)
