This JavaFX code implements a tab for copying, moving, or swapping field content between BibTeX entries in JabRef. It provides combo boxes to select source and target fields, a checkbox for overwriting content, and buttons for executing copy, move, and swap operations. The view validates inputs and disables buttons when operations aren't possible. It's part of JabRef's automatic field editor functionality, designed to manipulate bibliographic data efficiently.
