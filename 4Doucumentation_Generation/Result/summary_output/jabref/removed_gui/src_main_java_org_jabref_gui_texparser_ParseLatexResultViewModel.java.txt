This code defines a ViewModel (`ParseLatexResultViewModel`) for managing LaTeX parsing results in a JavaFX application. It processes citations and references from LaTeX files, highlighting new/unresolved entries. The class maintains observable lists for references and citations, tracks which entries need importing via a disabled button property, and provides methods to update the citation list when a reference is selected. It also handles importing unresolved references into a BibTeX database through a dialog interface. The ViewModel bridges between LaTeX parsing logic and the UI layer.
