The `OpenUrlAction` class is a command in JabRef that opens a URL, DOI, URI, or eprint link from a selected BibTeX entry. It checks if exactly one entry is selected and has one of these fields. The code prioritizes URL over DOI over URI over eprint. For DOIs, it uses custom handling if configured, otherwise opens the link in an external viewer. Errors are shown via a dialog service. The command is only executable when one entry with a valid link field is selected.
