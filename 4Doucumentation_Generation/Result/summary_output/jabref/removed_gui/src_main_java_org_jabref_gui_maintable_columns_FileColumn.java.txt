The `FileColumn` class creates a column in a table to display and manage linked files for bibliographic entries. It shows file icons based on file types (single or multiple files) and provides functionality to open files directly (single click) or via a context menu (multiple files). The column can be configured to show all files or filter by a specific file type. It includes tooltips and handles user interactions like mouse clicks to open files. The class uses preferences and database context to manage file operations and display settings.
