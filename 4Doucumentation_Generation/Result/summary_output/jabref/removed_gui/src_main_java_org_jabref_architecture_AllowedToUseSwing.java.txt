This code defines a custom annotation `@AllowedToUseSwing` in Java, specifically for marking logic classes that are permitted to access Swing (a GUI toolkit). The annotation includes a mandatory `value()` field to provide the rationale for why Swing access is allowed. This serves as architectural documentation and potentially enforces coding standards.
