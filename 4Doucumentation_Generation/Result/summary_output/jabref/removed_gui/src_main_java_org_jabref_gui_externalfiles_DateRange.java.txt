This code defines an enum `DateRange` representing different time periods (All time, Last year, month, week, day). Each enum value has a localized display name (e.g., "Last week") stored in the `dateRange` field. The constructor initializes this field, and `getDateRange()` retrieves the display name. Essentially, it provides a type-safe way to handle and display time range options with localization support. (98 words)
