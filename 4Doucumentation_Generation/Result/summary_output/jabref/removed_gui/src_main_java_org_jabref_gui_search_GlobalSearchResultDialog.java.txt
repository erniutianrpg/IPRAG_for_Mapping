This JavaFX code creates a dialog window for displaying global search results in JabRef, a reference management software. The dialog shows a split view with a table of search results on one side and a preview of the selected entry on the other. It includes features like keeping the window on top, remembering window size preferences, and synchronizing the preview with the selected table entry. The dialog is non-modal (doesn't block other windows) and uses MVVM architecture with dependency injection.
