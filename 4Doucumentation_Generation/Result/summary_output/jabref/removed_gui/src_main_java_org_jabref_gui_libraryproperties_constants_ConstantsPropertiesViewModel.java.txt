This code manages constants (BibTeX strings) in a JabRef library properties tab. It provides functionality to:
1. Load, display, and sort existing string constants
2. Add new strings with auto-generated unique labels
3. Remove strings
4. Validate string entries
5. Save changes back to the database
6. Open a help page for the string editor

The view-model maintains a list of string constants with validation and handles synchronization between UI and database.
