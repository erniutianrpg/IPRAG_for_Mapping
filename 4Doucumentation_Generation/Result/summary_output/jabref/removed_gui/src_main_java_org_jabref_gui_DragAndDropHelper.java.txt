The `DragAndDropHelper` class provides utility methods for handling drag-and-drop operations in a JavaFX application. It checks if dragged files are BibTeX files (`hasBibFiles`, `getBibFiles`) and if dragged content contains group data (`hasGroups`, `getGroups`). The methods filter and return relevant data from the `Dragboard`, returning empty lists if no matching content is found. This facilitates drag-and-drop functionality for BibTeX files and group operations in the UI. (98 words)
