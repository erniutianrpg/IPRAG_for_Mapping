This code defines a `LinkedFileViewModel` class in JabRef that manages operations for linked files in bibliography entries. Key functionalities include:

1. Handling file operations (open, rename, move, delete, download)
2. Validating file existence
3. Managing file metadata and icons
4. Supporting PDF metadata extraction and merging
5. Providing GUI interactions for file management
6. Handling both local and online files

The class acts as a bridge between the UI and backend file operations, with methods for common tasks like opening files in their default applications, downloading online files, and editing file properties. It also includes validation and error handling for file operations.
