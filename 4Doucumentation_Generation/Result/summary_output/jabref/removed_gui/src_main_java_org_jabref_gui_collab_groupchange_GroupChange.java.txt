The `GroupChange` class handles modifications to group structures in a JabRef database. It tracks differences between old and new group trees (`GroupDiff`) and provides functionality to apply these changes. When applied, it updates the database's group structure, either removing all groups or modifying them according to the new tree, while supporting undo operations via `NamedCompound`. The change is named based on whether groups were removed or modified. This class is part of JabRef's collaborative editing feature for group management.
