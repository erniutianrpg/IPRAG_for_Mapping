The `LibraryPropertiesViewModel` class manages various library property tabs (general, saving, constants, key patterns, content selectors) for a BibTeX database. It initializes these tabs with a given database context and provides methods to set their values (`setValues()`), save settings (`storeAllSettings()`), and retrieve the tabs (`getPropertiesTabs()`). Essentially, it serves as a central controller for handling different library property views. (98 words)
