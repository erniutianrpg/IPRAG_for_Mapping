The `ExternalFileType` interface defines methods for managing external file types in JabRef, including getting the file type's name, extension, MIME type, associated application, and icon. It provides default implementations for obtaining the corresponding BibTeX field (assuming it matches the extension) and converting the file type to a string array for storage in preferences. This interface serves as a blueprint for handling different file types within the JabRef reference manager. (98 words)
