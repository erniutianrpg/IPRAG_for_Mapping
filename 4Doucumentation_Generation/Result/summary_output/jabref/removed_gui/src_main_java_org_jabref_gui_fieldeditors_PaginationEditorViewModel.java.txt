The `PaginationEditorViewModel` class is a view model for a pagination field editor in JabRef. It maps short pagination types (like "page", "column") to their localized display names (e.g., "Page", "Column") using a bidirectional map. It extends `MapBasedEditorViewModel` and initializes the map with 7 key-value pairs. The class provides methods to access this map and convert values to display text, which in this case returns the input unchanged. This facilitates displaying and selecting pagination types in the UI while storing concise values internally.
