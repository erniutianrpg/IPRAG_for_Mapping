This code provides utility methods for managing undo operations in OpenOffice/LibreOffice documents. It retrieves an `XUndoManager` instance from a text document and offers methods to `enterUndoContext` (grouping changes under a title) and `leaveUndoContext` (ending the group). These methods must be called in pairs to maintain the undo stack's consistency. The code handles potential `InvalidStateException` during context leaving by throwing an `IllegalStateException`.
