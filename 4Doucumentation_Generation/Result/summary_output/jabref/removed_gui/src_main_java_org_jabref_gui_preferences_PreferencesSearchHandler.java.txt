This code implements a search functionality for preference tabs in a JavaFX application. It filters tabs based on user input, highlighting matching labels and tab names. The `PreferencesSearchHandler` class maintains a list of tabs and their labeled controls, searches for matches in tab names or labels, and updates the UI to show only relevant tabs with highlighted matches. It uses JavaFX properties for observable updates and CSS pseudo-classes for visual highlighting. The search is case-insensitive and clears when the input is empty.
