The `CopyFilesResultListDependency` class is a wrapper for a list of `CopyFilesResultItemViewModel` objects, designed to enable injection of complex types into FXML controllers. It provides constructors (default and with list initialization), a getter for the list, and a `toString()` method. This serves as a workaround for FXML's limitation in handling complex object types directly. (94 words)
