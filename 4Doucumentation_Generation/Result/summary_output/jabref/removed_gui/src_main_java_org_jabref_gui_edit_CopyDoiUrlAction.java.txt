This JavaFX command class copies either a DOI URL or plain DOI to the clipboard from a TextArea. Depending on the action type (COPY_DOI_URL or other), it parses the text as a DOI, converts it to either a URL or plain DOI format, and copies it to the clipboard. If successful, it shows a confirmation; if invalid, it displays an error message. The code is part of the JabRef reference management software. (98 words)
