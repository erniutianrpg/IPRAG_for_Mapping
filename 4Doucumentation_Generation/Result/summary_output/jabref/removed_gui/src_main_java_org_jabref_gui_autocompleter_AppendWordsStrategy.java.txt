This code implements an auto-completion strategy that splits input text at the last space character. It returns an `AutoCompletionInput` object containing two parts: the prefix (everything before the last space, including the space) and the remainder (everything after). If no space is found, the entire input is treated as the remainder with an empty prefix. This helps in suggesting completions for the last word while preserving the preceding text.
