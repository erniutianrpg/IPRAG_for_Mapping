The `StyleSheetResource` class represents a stylesheet resource loaded from a URL. It extends `StyleSheet` and provides methods to: 
1. Get the stylesheet URL for JavaFX scenes (`getSceneStylesheet`)
2. Convert the URL to a string for web engine use (`getWebEngineStylesheet`)
3. A no-op `reload` method (as URL resources don't need reloading)
4. A string representation for debugging. Essentially, it's a wrapper for URL-based stylesheets. (98 words)
