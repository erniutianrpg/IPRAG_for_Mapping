The `DateEditorViewModel` class handles date formatting and parsing for a field editor in JabRef. It uses a `DateTimeFormatter` to convert between `TemporalAccessor` objects (dates) and strings. The `getDateToStringConverter` method provides a bidirectional converter: formatting dates to strings (with error handling) and parsing strings to dates (accepting various formats, falling back to a flexible parser if the main format fails). It extends `AbstractEditorViewModel` for basic field editor functionality.
