The `FieldValueCellViewModel` class manages the state and behavior of a field value cell in a JavaFX UI. It contains properties for: 
1. The field's text value (`fieldValue`)
2. Selection status (`selected`) 
3. A toggle group (`toggleGroup`) for radio button functionality
It provides getter/setter methods and property accessors for these attributes, enabling data binding and observation in the UI. The class serves as a view model for a cell that can display, select, and group field values.
