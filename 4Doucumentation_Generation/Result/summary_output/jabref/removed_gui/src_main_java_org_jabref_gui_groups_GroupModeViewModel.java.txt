The `GroupModeViewModel` class manages the visual representation and tooltips for group view modes (UNION or INTERSECTION) in a JavaFX application. It provides methods to get the appropriate icon graphic (`getUnionIntersectionGraphic`) and localized tooltip text (`getUnionIntersectionTooltip`) based on the current mode. The UNION mode displays a union icon and a tooltip for toggling to intersection, while the INTERSECTION mode shows an intersection icon with a tooltip for toggling to union. Defaults to intersection icon if mode is unspecified.
