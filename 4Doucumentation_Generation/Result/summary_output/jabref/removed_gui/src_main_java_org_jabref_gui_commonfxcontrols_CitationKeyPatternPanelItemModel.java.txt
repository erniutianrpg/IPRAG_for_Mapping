This JavaFX class `CitationKeyPatternPanelItemModel` represents a model for citation key patterns in JabRef. It stores an `EntryType` (e.g., article, book) and a pattern string (e.g., citation format) as observable properties. The class provides getters/setters for both properties and ensures non-null values in the constructor. The `toString()` method formats the data as `[EntryTypeName,Pattern]`. It's used to manage citation key patterns in JabRef's UI. (98 words)
