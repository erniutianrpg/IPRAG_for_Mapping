This code provides utility methods to control screen refresh in OpenOffice/LibreOffice documents. It offers three static methods: `lockControllers()` to disable screen updates, `unlockControllers()` to re-enable them, and `hasControllersLocked()` to check if updates are currently locked. These methods operate on an `XTextDocument` instance, helping optimize performance by preventing unnecessary screen refreshes during batch operations. The class is not meant to be instantiated (private constructor).
