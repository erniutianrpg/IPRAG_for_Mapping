The `ThemeManager` class manages CSS themes (Light, Dark, Custom) for a JavaFX application, enabling live reloading of stylesheets when files change. It handles base and additional CSS files, monitors updates via `FileUpdateMonitor`, and applies changes to scenes and web engines. It also manages font size settings and provides theme installation for both JavaFX scenes and WebEngine instances. The class ensures graceful degradation if custom CSS files become unavailable.
