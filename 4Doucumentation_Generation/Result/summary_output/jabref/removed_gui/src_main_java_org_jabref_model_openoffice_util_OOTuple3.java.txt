The `OOTuple3` class is a simple generic container that holds three objects of different types (`A`, `B`, `C`). It provides a way to group these objects together without creating a custom class, exposing them as immutable public fields `a`, `b`, and `c`. This is useful for passing or returning three related values as a single unit.
