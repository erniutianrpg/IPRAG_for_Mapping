The `OpenExternalLinkAction` class is a command that opens a DOI or URL in the default browser. It checks if the input string is a valid DOI, converts it to a URI if so, or directly opens it as a URL. If the link is invalid or inaccessible, it logs a warning. This simplifies handling external links in the application.
