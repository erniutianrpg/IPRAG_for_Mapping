The `EditorTypeEditorViewModel` class is a specialized editor for handling editor-type fields in JabRef. It maps specific editor roles (like "editor", "compiler") to their localized display names using a bidirectional map. The class extends `MapBasedEditorViewModel` and initializes the map with 7 key-value pairs. It overrides methods to return this map and convert values to display text. Essentially, it provides a dropdown-like functionality with predefined editor types and their translations. (98 words)
