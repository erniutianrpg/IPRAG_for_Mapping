The `SidePaneComponent` class creates a customizable side panel for a JavaFX application. It includes a header with a title, close button, and up/down movement buttons, with functionality provided by command objects. The panel's content is generated by a `SidePaneContentFactory`. The component supports additional buttons in the header and adjusts its growth behavior based on the panel type (e.g., GROUPS expands vertically). The UI is styled with CSS classes.
