The `ChainedFilters` class implements a composite filter for directory paths that combines multiple filters. It only accepts a path if all its constituent filters accept it. If any filter throws an `IOException`, it logs the error but continues processing (returning `true` by default). Essentially, it performs a logical AND operation across all filters in the chain.
