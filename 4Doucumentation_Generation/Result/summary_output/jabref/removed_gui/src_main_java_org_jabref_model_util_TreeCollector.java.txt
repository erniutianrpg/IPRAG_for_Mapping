This code implements a Java `Collector` that merges a list of tree nodes into a hierarchical tree structure. It uses three key functions: `getChildren` to retrieve child nodes, `addChild` to add nodes to parents, and `equivalence` to check node equality. The collector processes nodes, merging duplicates and their children while preserving the tree structure. The result is an observable list of root nodes forming a forest. Characteristics include unordered processing and identity finish.
