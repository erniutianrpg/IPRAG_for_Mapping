The `DeleteFileAction` class handles deletion of linked files in a JabRef GUI. It provides two options: removing file references from entries or permanently deleting files from disk. When executed, it shows a confirmation dialog with these choices. For disk deletion, it locates and deletes the physical file, handling errors like permission issues. For online links, it only removes the reference. The action operates on selected files in a ListView and integrates with JabRef's database context and preferences.
