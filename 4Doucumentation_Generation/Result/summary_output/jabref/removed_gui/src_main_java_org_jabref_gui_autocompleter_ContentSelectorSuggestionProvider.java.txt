The `ContentSelectorSuggestionProvider` class enhances a suggestion provider by combining its suggestions with predefined content selector values. It extends `StringSuggestionProvider` and merges two sources of suggestions: those from the wrapped `SuggestionProvider` and the provided `contentSelectorValues`. The `getSource()` method concatenates both streams, while `getPossibleSuggestions()` combines both collections into a single list. This allows for autocompletion that includes both dynamic suggestions and static predefined values. (98 words)
