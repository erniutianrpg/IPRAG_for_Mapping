This code provides auto-completion suggestions for a specific field in a BibTeX database. The `FieldValueSuggestionProvider` class extends `StringSuggestionProvider` and retrieves all values from a given field across all entries in the database. When `getSource()` is called, it returns a stream of these field values for auto-completion purposes. The class requires a `Field` (to specify which field to search) and a `BibDatabase` (the database to search in) during initialization.
