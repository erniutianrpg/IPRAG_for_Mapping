The `CountingUndoManager` extends Java's `UndoManager` to track undo/redo actions and notify listeners of changes. It maintains an `unchangedPoint` to detect modifications and uses an `EventBus` to post events when actions are added, undone, or redone. Key features include marking unchanged states, checking if changes exist, and notifying registered listeners about undo/redo capabilities with localized presentation names. This class enhances basic undo functionality with change tracking and event-based notifications.
