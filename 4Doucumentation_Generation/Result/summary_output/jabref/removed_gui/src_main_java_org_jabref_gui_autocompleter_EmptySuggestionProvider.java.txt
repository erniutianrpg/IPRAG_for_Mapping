The `EmptySuggestionProvider` class is a no-op implementation of a suggestion provider for auto-completion. It returns no suggestions (`Stream.empty()`), never matches any input (`isMatch` always returns `false`), and uses basic equality comparison and natural ordering for strings. Essentially, it provides empty auto-completion results.
