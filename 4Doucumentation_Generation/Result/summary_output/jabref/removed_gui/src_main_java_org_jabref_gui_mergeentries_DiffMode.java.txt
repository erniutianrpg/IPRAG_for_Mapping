This code defines an enum `DiffMode` that represents different text comparison modes for merging entries in JabRef. It offers five modes: plain (no diff), word-by-word, character-by-character, and symmetric versions of the last two. Each mode has a localized display text. The `parse` method converts a string to a `DiffMode` (defaulting to WORD if invalid), and `getDisplayText` returns the mode's descriptive text. The enum facilitates different merge strategies in the UI. (98 words)
