The `FieldRowView` class manages the display and merging of field values in a three-way merge interface for BibTeX entries. It coordinates between left, right, and merged field values, handles user selection (left/right/none), toggles merge states, and shows/hides diff highlighting between left and right values. The class uses JavaFX properties for bidirectional binding and updates the UI accordingly, including showing unified or split diffs when values differ. It also manages row visibility in a parent GridPane.
