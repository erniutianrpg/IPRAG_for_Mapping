The `UnlinkedFilesCrawler` class searches a directory recursively for files not linked to a BibTeX database. It filters files based on type (e.g., PDFs), Git ignore rules, and modification date, then organizes them into a tree structure (`FileNodeViewModel`). The results are sorted by date and exclude linked or ignored files. This is implemented as a background task to avoid blocking the UI. The main output is a hierarchical view of unlinked files.
