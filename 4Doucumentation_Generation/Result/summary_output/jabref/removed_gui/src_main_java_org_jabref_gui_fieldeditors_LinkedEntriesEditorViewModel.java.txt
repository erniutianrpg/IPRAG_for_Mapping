This JavaFX ViewModel class (`LinkedEntriesEditorViewModel`) manages linked bibliographic entries in JabRef. It maintains a list of linked entries (`ParsedEntryLink`) and provides bidirectional binding between the text representation and parsed entries. The class includes a string converter for display/edit purposes and a placeholder method (`jumpToEntry`) for future navigation functionality. It's part of JabRef's field editor system, handling entry links within a BibTeX database context.
