The `UndoRedoAction` class implements undo and redo functionality for a library tab in JabRef. It extends `SimpleCommand` and handles two actions: `StandardActions.UNDO` and `StandardActions.REDO`. When executed, it calls the respective undo/redo methods on the library tab's `UndoManager`, marks the tab as changed, and notifies the user. If no undo/redo is possible, it displays an appropriate message. The action's executability is bound to whether a database is open.
