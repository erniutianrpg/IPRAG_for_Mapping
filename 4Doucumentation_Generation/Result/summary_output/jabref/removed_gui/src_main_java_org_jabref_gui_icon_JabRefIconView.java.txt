The `JabRefIconView` class extends `FontIcon` to display icons from the JabRef icon set. It provides properties for managing the icon (`glyph`) and its size (`glyphSize`), with constructors allowing initialization with specific icons and sizes. The class includes methods to get/set these properties and automatically updates the displayed icon and size when properties change using `EasyBind`. Defaults to an ERROR icon if none is specified. Designed for FXML compatibility with proper type validation.
