The `CopyFilesDialogViewModel` class manages a list of file copy operation results for a JavaFX UI. It extends `AbstractViewModel` and maintains an observable list (`copyFilesResultItems`) of `CopyFilesResultItemViewModel` objects. The constructor initializes this list with results from a `CopyFilesResultListDependency`. The `copyFilesResultListProperty()` method provides access to the list property for data binding in the UI. Essentially, it acts as a view model for displaying file copy results in a dialog. (98 words)
