This JavaFX code defines a dialog (`CopyFilesDialogView`) for displaying file copy operation results. It shows a table with three columns: file status (using icons, green for success, red for warnings), message, and file path. The dialog is initialized with a list of results (`CopyFilesResultListDependency`) and includes an OK button. The table is set up to display each result item's file path, message, and status icon with appropriate coloring. The dialog uses the MVVM pattern with `CopyFilesDialogViewModel` managing the data.
