The `IntegrityCheckDialog` class implements a JavaFX dialog for displaying and filtering integrity check messages in JabRef. It shows a table of `IntegrityMessage` objects with columns for entry key, field, and message. Users can filter messages by these columns using context menus. Selecting a message opens the corresponding entry in the library tab for editing. The dialog supports theme management and provides methods to clear filters. It's a non-modal dialog that integrates with JabRef's UI framework.
