The `FieldRowViewModel` class manages the merging of field values between two BibTeX entries (`leftEntry` and `rightEntry`) into a third `mergedEntry`. It tracks selections (left, right, or custom value), handles field merging/unmerging with undo/redo support, and synchronizes values between entries. The class uses JavaFX properties for binding and updates, and includes logic for field-specific merging via `FieldMergerFactory`. It's part of a larger dialog for merging bibliographic entries in JabRef.
