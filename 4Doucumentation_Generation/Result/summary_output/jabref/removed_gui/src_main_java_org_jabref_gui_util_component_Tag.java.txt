This code defines a `Tag` component for a JavaFX `TagBar`. It displays a tag with text and a remove button. The tag's text is dynamically bound to a value using a provided `toString` function. When the remove button is clicked, it triggers a callback (`tagRemovedConsumer`) with the tag's value. The component supports generic types (`T`) for flexibility and uses properties for value binding. It's built using JavaFX and Afterburner for FXML view loading.
