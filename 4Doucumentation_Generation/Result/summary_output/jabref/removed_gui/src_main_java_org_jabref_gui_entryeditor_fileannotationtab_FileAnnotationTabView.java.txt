This JavaFX code implements a tab for displaying and managing file annotations (like PDF comments) associated with a BibTeX entry. It shows a list of annotated files in a dropdown, displays annotations in a list view, and provides detailed views of selected annotations (content, author, page, date). The UI updates dynamically when selections change, and annotations can be copied. The class uses MVVM pattern with data binding between the view and ViewModel.
