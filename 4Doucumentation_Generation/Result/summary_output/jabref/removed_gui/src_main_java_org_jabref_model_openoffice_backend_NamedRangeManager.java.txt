The `NamedRangeManager` interface defines methods for managing named ranges in a text document. It allows creating named ranges at cursor positions (with options for spacing and brackets), retrieving a list of used range names, and fetching a specific named range by its name. The methods throw exceptions for document-related errors (missing document or creation/wrapped target issues). This interface is part of a backend system for OpenOffice/LibreOffice integration.
