The `DocumentViewerViewModel` class manages a document viewer UI component in JabRef. It handles PDF document viewing functionality, including: 
- Tracking currently selected BibTeX entries and their linked files
- Managing PDF document loading and page navigation (next/previous/specific page)
- Supporting "live mode" to automatically update when entries are selected
- Maintaining document state (current page, max pages) with JavaFX property bindings
- Handling file operations and preferences through injected dependencies

The class acts as a bridge between the UI and document operations, particularly for PDF files.
