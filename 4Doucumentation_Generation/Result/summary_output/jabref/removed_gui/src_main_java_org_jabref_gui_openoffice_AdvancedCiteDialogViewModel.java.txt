The `AdvancedCiteDialogViewModel` class manages the state for an advanced citation dialog in JabRef. It provides three observable properties: `pageInfo` (a string for page information), `citeInPar` (a boolean for paragraph citation), and `citeInText` (a boolean for in-text citation). Each property has a corresponding getter method, allowing the UI to bind to and observe changes in these values. This class serves as a view model for controlling citation preferences in the OpenOffice/LibreOffice integration. (79 words)
