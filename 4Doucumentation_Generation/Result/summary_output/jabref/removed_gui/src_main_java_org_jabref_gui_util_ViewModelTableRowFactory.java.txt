This code defines a `ViewModelTableRowFactory` class that creates customizable JavaFX `TableRow` instances for a `TableView`. It provides methods to configure various row behaviors including mouse clicks, context menus, drag-and-drop events, and tooltips. The factory uses a fluent interface pattern for configuration and handles event propagation to the view model. The main functionality is creating table rows with these configurable interactive features while managing event handling and empty row cases.
