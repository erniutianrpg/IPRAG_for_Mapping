The `ImportCommand` class handles file import operations in JabRef, a reference management software. It allows users to import entries either into a new database or the currently open one. The command presents a file dialog for selecting import files, filters supported formats, and checks file existence. Upon selection, it uses the appropriate importer to process the file and updates the last import directory preference. The import is performed via `ImportAction`, which manages the actual import process.
