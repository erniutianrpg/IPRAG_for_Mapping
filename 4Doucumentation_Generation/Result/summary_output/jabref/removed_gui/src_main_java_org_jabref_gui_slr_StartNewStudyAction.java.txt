The `StartNewStudyAction` class initiates a new systematic literature review (SLR) study. It allows users to input study metadata through a dialog, creates a study definition YAML file, initializes a Git repository with an "Initial commit", and triggers the crawling process (inherited from `ExistingStudySearchAction`) to gather research data. The class handles study directory setup and error checking for invalid inputs.
