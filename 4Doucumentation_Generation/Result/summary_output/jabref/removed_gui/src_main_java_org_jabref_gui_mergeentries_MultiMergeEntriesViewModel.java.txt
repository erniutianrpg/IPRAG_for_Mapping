The `MultiMergeEntriesViewModel` class manages the merging of multiple `BibEntry` sources (e.g., bibliographic entries) into a single merged entry. It tracks entries to merge (`entries`), the merged result (`mergedEntry`), and any failed sources (`failedSuppliers`). The `addSource` method adds new sources and updates fields once loaded, while `updateFields` ensures all fields from sources are included in the merged entry. The `EntrySource` nested class represents individual sources, handling loading states asynchronously. The merged entry is returned if the operation is confirmed.
