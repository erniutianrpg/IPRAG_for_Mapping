The code defines a simple Java enumeration called `Sources` with two possible values: `FromButton` and `FromMenu`. This enum is likely used to indicate the origin or source of an action in a GUI application, distinguishing whether an action was triggered from a button click or a menu selection. The enum provides a type-safe way to represent these two distinct sources.
