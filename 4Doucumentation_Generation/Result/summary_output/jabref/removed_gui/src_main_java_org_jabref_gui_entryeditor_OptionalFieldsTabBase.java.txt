The `OptionalFieldsTabBase` class extends `FieldsEditorTab` to display optional fields of a BibTeX entry in JabRef's entry editor. It shows either primary or secondary optional fields based on the `isPrimaryOptionalFields` flag. The fields to display are determined by the entry type and database mode, using `BibEntryTypesManager`. If the entry type is unknown, no fields are shown. The tab includes a title, tooltip, and icon for user interface presentation.
