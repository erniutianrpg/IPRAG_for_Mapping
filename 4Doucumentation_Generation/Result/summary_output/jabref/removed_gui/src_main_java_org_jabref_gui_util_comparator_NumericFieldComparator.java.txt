The `NumericFieldComparator` class implements a `Comparator<String>` to numerically compare two strings. It first checks if the strings can be parsed as integers. If both are non-numeric, it falls back to string comparison. If only one is numeric, the numeric value is considered larger. If both are numeric, their integer values are compared. The helper methods `parseInt` and `isNumber` validate and parse strings as integers, handling edge cases like empty strings or signs. This ensures proper numeric ordering instead of lexicographic string sorting. (98 words)
