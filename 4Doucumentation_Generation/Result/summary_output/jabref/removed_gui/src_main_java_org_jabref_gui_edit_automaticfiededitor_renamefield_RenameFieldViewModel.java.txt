This code defines a ViewModel for renaming fields in BibTeX entries within the JabRef application. It provides:

1. Validation for field names (non-empty, no whitespace)
2. Binding properties to track selected fields and new field names
3. A method `renameField()` that executes the field renaming operation using `MoveFieldValueAction`
4. Undo support via `NamedCompound`
5. State management to track affected entries

The class extends `AbstractAutomaticFieldEditorTabViewModel` and handles the logic for renaming fields in selected bibliography entries while maintaining data integrity through validation.
