The `LastAutomaticFieldEditorEdit` class extends `AbstractUndoableEdit` to manage undo/redo functionality for automatic field edits in JabRef. It tracks the number of affected entries, the tab index, and the compound edit operation. The class overrides `undo()` and `redo()` methods to delegate these actions to the stored `NamedCompound` edit, enabling undo/redo support for batch field modifications. (98 words)
