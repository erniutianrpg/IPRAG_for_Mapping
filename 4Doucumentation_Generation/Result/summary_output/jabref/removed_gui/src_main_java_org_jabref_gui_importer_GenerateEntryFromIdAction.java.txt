The `GenerateEntryFromIdAction` class creates a bibliographic entry by fetching metadata using an identifier (e.g., DOI, ISBN). It performs the search in the background, handles success/failure cases, and notifies the user. On success, it imports the entry with duplicate checks; on failure, it offers manual entry creation. The process is managed via a pop-over UI and includes error handling for client/server issues.
