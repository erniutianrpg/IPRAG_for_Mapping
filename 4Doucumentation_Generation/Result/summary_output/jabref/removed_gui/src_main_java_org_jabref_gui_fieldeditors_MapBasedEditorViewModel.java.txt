This code defines an abstract `MapBasedEditorViewModel` class for field editors that display options backed by a bidirectional map (BiMap). It provides string conversion between map keys and values, handles null cases, and offers default type conversion with fallback to string representation. The class also supplies all map values as items and allows subclasses to customize value conversion from strings. It's part of a JabRef GUI component for managing field editors with predefined options.
