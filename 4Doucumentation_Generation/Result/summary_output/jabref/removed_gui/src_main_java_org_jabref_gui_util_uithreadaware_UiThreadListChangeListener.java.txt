The `UiThreadListChangeListener` class wraps a `ListChangeListener` to ensure its `onChanged` method is executed on the JavaFX UI thread. It delegates all operations to the wrapped listener, including `equals` and `hashCode`, while using `UiThreadHelper` to enforce UI thread execution for change events. This is useful for thread-safe UI updates in JavaFX applications. (98 words)
