The `GroupMerger` class merges two group fields (from bibliographic entries) separated by commas. If either field is blank, it returns the non-blank one. If both are non-blank, it combines them, splits by commas, removes duplicates, and joins them back with commas. This ensures unique groups are preserved in the merged result.
