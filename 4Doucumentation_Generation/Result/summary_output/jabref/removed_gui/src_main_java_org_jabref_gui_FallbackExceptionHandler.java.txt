This code implements a fallback exception handler for uncaught exceptions in Java threads. When installed, it logs any uncaught exceptions using SLF4J and displays an error dialog in the JavaFX application thread via `JabRefGUI`. The handler ensures exceptions are both logged and shown to the user in a GUI dialog, preventing silent failures. The main method `installExceptionHandler()` sets this as the default handler for all threads.
