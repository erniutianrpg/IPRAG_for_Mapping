This code provides utility methods `showContextMenu` for displaying context menus in JavaFX `TextField` and `TextArea` components. It handles positioning the menu relative to touch or mouse events, ensures the menu stays within screen bounds, and adjusts placement if near screen edges. The implementation is adapted from internal JavaFX classes as a workaround since those APIs aren't publicly accessible.
