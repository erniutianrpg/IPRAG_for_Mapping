The `EntryEditorPreferences` class manages configuration settings for an entry editor in JabRef. It stores preferences like tab organization (as a map of tab names to field sets), boolean flags for various editor behaviors (e.g., showing recommendation/Latex tabs, enabling validation), and UI properties like divider position. Each preference is wrapped in JavaFX properties, allowing observable changes and binding. The class provides getter/setter methods for each property, enabling external access and modification of these preferences.
