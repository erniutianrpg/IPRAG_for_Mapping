This JavaFX code implements a document viewer dialog for the JabRef reference manager. It provides functionality to:
- Display PDF/document files with scrollable content
- Switch between different files via a dropdown
- Navigate pages (next/previous/goto)
- Adjust zoom (in/out/fit width/fit single page)
- Toggle between live and locked viewing modes
- Show current/max page numbers
The viewer binds to a ViewModel for document management and uses various JavaFX controls for UI interaction.
