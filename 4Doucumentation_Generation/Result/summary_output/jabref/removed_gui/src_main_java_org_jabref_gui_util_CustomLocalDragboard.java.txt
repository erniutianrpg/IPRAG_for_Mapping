The `CustomLocalDragboard` class provides a type-safe drag-and-drop functionality for storing and retrieving objects, specifically `BibEntry` lists and `PreviewLayout` lists. It uses a map to store objects by their class type, with methods to put, get, check for, and clear values. The class ensures thread safety by clearing previous content before adding new values and offers convenience methods for common data types. It's designed for internal use within JabRef's GUI, particularly through `StateManager`.
