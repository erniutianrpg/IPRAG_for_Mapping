This code manages a LaTeX citations tab in JabRef's entry editor. It searches for citations of a selected BibTeX entry in LaTeX files within a specified directory. The view model handles directory selection, file parsing (using DefaultLatexParser), and citation matching. It provides status updates (in progress, found, no results, error) and allows canceling ongoing searches. The functionality is triggered when a BibEntry with a citation key is selected, and it can be configured to show/hide via preferences.
