The `UndoableMoveGroup` class implements undo/redo functionality for moving a group node in a tree hierarchy within JabRef. It stores the original and new parent paths and child indices. The `undo()` method reverts the move by restoring the node to its original position, while `redo()` reapplies the move to the new position. The class extends `AbstractUndoableJabRefEdit` to integrate with JabRef's undo system, with a presentation name "move group".
