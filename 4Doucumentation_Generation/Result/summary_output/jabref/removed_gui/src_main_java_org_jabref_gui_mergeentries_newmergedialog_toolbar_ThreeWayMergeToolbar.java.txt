This JavaFX class implements a toolbar for a three-way merge dialog in JabRef. It provides UI controls to:
1. Toggle between plain text or diff view
2. Select unified or split diff view
3. Choose character or word-level diff highlighting
4. Show only changed fields
5. Select left/right entry values
The toolbar loads/saves user preferences and manages view states through property bindings. It uses FXML for layout and Afterburner for dependency injection.
