This code implements a context menu for a JavaFX table header in JabRef's main table. The menu allows users to toggle the visibility of columns, including common fields like author, title, and year. It displays currently visible columns first, followed by a separator and other available columns. When clicked, each menu item toggles the column's visibility in the table. The class handles column management (adding/removing) and maintains the state of each column's visibility and position.
