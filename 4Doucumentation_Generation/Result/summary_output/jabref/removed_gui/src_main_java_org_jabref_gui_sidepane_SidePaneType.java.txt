This code defines an enum `SidePaneType` that represents different components in a side pane of a JabRef GUI application. Each enum value (OPEN_OFFICE, WEB_SEARCH, GROUPS) has a title, icon, and toggle action associated with it. The enum provides methods to access these properties (`getTitle()`, `getIcon()`, `getToggleAction()`). It essentially serves as a configuration for side pane components, linking visual elements (title, icon) with their corresponding actions.
