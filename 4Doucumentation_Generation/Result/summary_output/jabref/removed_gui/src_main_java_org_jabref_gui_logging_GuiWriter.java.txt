The `GuiWriter` class is a custom log writer for JabRef that extends `AbstractFormatPatternWriter`. It captures all log entry values (message, level, exception, etc.) and forwards them to JabRef's central log message handler (`LogMessages`). The writer doesn't perform any special flushing or closing operations. Its main purpose is to route log entries to JabRef's GUI logging system.
