This JavaFX dialog allows users to edit external file type associations in JabRef. It provides options to either use the default application or specify a custom application for opening files of a given type. The dialog includes fields for file extension, name, MIME type, and application path, with a browse button to select an application. The selections are managed via a view model that binds UI elements to properties. When OK is clicked, the settings are saved. The dialog is part of JabRef's preferences system for configuring external file handling. (98 words)
