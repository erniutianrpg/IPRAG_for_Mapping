The `BackupUIManager` class handles backup-related user dialogs in JabRef. It provides methods to restore or review backups when a file is opened. The `showRestoreBackupDialog` method prompts the user to either restore from a backup or review changes. The `showReviewBackupDialog` method compares the original and backup databases, displays differences in a dialog, and allows the user to resolve conflicts. The class ensures thread-safe UI operations and handles IO errors during backup loading.
