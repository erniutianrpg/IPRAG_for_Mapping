The `SearchDescriber` interface is a functional interface that defines a single method `getDescription()`, which returns a `TextFlow` object. This suggests it's used to generate formatted text descriptions (likely for search rules or results) in JavaFX applications, where the description can include styled text elements. Being a functional interface, it can be implemented with a lambda expression or method reference.
