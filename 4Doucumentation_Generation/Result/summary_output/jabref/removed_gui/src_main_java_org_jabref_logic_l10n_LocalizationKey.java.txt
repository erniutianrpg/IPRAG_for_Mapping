The `LocalizationKey` class handles localization keys for translation, where the key is English text. It escapes special characters (spaces, #, !, =, :) and newlines for properties file compatibility. The class provides methods to create keys from plain or escaped strings and to retrieve the original or escaped key values. Key functionality includes escaping characters in keys for property files while preserving the original key.
