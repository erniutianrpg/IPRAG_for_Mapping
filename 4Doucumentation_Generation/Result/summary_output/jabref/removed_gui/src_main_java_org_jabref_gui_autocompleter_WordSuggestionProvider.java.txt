This code provides word suggestions for auto-completion in a JabRef GUI by extracting all words from a specified field in a BibTeX database. The `WordSuggestionProvider` class takes a field (e.g., "author" or "title") and a database, then streams all words from that field across all entries in the database for use in auto-completion. It extends `StringSuggestionProvider` and overrides `getSource()` to return a parallel stream of words from the specified field.
