This code defines a `ViewModelTreeCellFactory` class that creates customizable tree cells for JavaFX `TreeView` components. It provides methods to configure cell text, graphics (including icons), tooltips, and mouse-click handlers using callback functions. The factory can generate either standard `TreeCell` or `CheckBoxTreeCell` items, converting view model data into display elements. The main functionality is creating and configuring tree cells based on the provided view model and converters.
