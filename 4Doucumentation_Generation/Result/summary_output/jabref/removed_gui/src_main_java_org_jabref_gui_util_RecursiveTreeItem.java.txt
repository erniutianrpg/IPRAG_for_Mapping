This code implements a recursive `CheckBoxTreeItem` for JavaFX that dynamically builds and filters a tree structure. Key features:
1. Lazily loads children nodes using a callback (`childrenFactory`)
2. Supports filtering nodes with a predicate (showing parents if children match)
3. Manages node expansion state through a callback (`expandedProperty`)
4. Automatically updates the tree when values change
5. Uses `FilteredList` to efficiently handle filtered views

The tree maintains bidirectional bindings for expansion state and dynamically filters nodes while preserving hierarchy when child nodes match the filter.
