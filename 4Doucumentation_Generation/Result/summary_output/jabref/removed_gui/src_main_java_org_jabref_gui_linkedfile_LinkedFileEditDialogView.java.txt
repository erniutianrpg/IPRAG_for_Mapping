This JavaFX dialog allows users to edit a linked file's properties (URL/link, description, and file type) in JabRef. It initializes with an existing `LinkedFile` object, provides input fields bound to a view model, and handles user actions. When "Apply" is clicked, it returns the updated file; otherwise, it returns null. The dialog also includes a browse button to select files externally. The UI elements are connected to the view model via bidirectional bindings for seamless data synchronization.
