The `ShowPreferencesAction` class is a command that displays the preferences dialog in the JabRef application. When executed, it creates a `DialogService` instance and uses it to show a custom preferences dialog (`PreferencesDialogView`), passing the main `JabRefFrame` as a parameter. This allows users to view and modify application preferences. The class extends `SimpleCommand` for easy integration with GUI actions.
