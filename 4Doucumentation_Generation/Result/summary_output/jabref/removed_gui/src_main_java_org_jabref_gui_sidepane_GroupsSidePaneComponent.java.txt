The `GroupsSidePaneComponent` class implements a side panel component for managing group view modes (union/intersection) in JabRef. It provides a toggle button in the header to switch between viewing groups as a union or intersection. The button's icon and tooltip update based on the current mode. When toggled, it changes the group view mode preference and shows a notification. The component integrates with JabRef's UI framework and preferences system.
