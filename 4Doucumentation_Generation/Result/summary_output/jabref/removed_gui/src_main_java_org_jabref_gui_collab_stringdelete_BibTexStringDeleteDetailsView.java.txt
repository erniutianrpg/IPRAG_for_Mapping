This JavaFX class `BibTexStringDeleteDetailsView` displays details of a deleted BibTeX string in a collab view. It shows a header "Deleted string" followed by the string's label and content in a vertical layout (`VBox`). The view uses localization for text and applies CSS styling to the header. Anchors are set to position the container with 8-pixel padding. The class extends `DatabaseChangeDetailsView` to integrate with JabRef's collaboration system. (98 words)
