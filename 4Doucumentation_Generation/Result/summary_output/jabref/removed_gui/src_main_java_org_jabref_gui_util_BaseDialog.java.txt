This code defines a `BaseDialog` class for JavaFX dialogs in JabRef. It provides common functionality:  
1. Closes the dialog when the CLOSE keybinding is pressed  
2. Triggers the default button action when DEFAULT_DIALOG_ACTION is pressed  
3. Allows buttons to be triggered with the Enter key  
4. Sets a default JabRef icon and makes the dialog resizable  
5. Includes helper methods to get the default button and button type  

It serves as a base class for consistent dialog behavior across the application. (98 words)
