The `UiThreadBinding` class wraps a JavaFX `Binding` to ensure all listener notifications (for invalidation or value changes) are executed on the JavaFX Application Thread. This is crucial for UI updates, which must occur on the main thread. The class delegates all binding operations to the wrapped `Binding` but intercepts listener registrations to wrap them with thread-aware listeners (`UiThreadInvalidationListener` and `UiThreadChangeListener`). This ensures thread safety when background threads modify bound values that affect the UI.
