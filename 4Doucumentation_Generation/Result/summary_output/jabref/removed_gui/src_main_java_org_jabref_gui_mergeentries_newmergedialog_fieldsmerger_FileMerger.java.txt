The `FileMerger` class merges two file fields from BibTeX entries. It checks if either field is empty and returns the non-empty one. If both contain files, it parses them into `LinkedFile` objects, concatenates the lists, converts them back to strings, and joins them without separators. The merger handles malformed strings by potentially producing empty lists (noted as a TODO).
