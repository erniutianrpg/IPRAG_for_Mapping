The `AutomaticFieldEditorViewModel` class manages a field editor dialog in JabRef, providing functionality to edit, copy/move, and rename fields in BibTeX entries. It maintains a list of editor tabs (`EditFieldContentTabView`, `CopyOrMoveFieldContentTabView`, `RenameFieldTabView`) and handles undo/redo operations via `UndoManager`. Changes can be saved (added to undo stack) or canceled (reverted). The class acts as a view-model in the MVVM pattern, coordinating between the UI and data operations.
