This code handles the deletion of a `BibtexString` (a string variable) in a BibTeX database within the JabRef application. It extends `DatabaseChange` to represent the deletion operation, provides an undoable action via `UndoableRemoveString`, and logs errors if the deletion fails. The change is named with the deleted string's name for user reference.
