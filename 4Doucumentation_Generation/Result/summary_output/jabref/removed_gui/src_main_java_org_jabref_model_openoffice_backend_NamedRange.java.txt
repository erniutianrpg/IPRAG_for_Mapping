The `NamedRange` interface provides methods to manage named text ranges (reference marks or bookmarks) in LibreOffice/OpenOffice documents. It allows retrieving range names, accessing text ranges or cursors for reading or filling text, cleaning up formatting after edits, and removing ranges from documents. Implementations focus on reference marks currently. Methods handle document absence and target exceptions, with some operations requiring cleanup steps.
