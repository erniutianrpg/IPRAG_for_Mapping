This code defines an `EntryDelete` class representing a deletion change in a BibTeX database. It tracks a deleted `BibEntry`, provides a human-readable change description, and implements `applyChange` to remove the entry from the database while creating an undoable action. The class is part of a larger change-tracking system in JabRef, allowing users to undo deletions. (98 words)
