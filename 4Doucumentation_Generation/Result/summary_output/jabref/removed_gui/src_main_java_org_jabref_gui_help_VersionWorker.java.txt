The `VersionWorker` class checks for new versions of JabRef by querying available versions from a server. It can perform checks either immediately (`checkForNewVersionAsync`) or after a delay (`checkForNewVersionDelayed`). If a newer version is found, it displays a dialog offering update options; if not, it notifies the user (if manually triggered). Connection errors are logged and shown if manual. The user can ignore specific versions, which are stored in preferences. The class handles both automated and manual version checks with appropriate user feedback.
