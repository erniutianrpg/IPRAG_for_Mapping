This code implements a JavaFX dialog for JabRef that searches for unlinked local files in a specified directory. The dialog allows users to:  
1. Select a directory and filter files by type/date  
2. Scan for unlinked files and display them in a tree view  
3. Select files to import/export  
4. View import results in a table  
5. Includes context menu actions (select all, expand/collapse)  

The UI binds to a ViewModel that handles file operations, validation, and background tasks.
