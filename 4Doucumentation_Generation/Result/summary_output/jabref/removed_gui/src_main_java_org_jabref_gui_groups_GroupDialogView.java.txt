This code implements a JavaFX dialog for creating/editing groups in JabRef, a reference management software. The dialog allows users to:
1. Configure basic group properties (name, description, icon, color)
2. Select group type (explicit, keyword-based, search-based, automatic, or TeX)
3. Set type-specific parameters (search terms, fields, case sensitivity, etc.)
4. Validate inputs before submission
5. Browse for icons via a popover picker
6. Handle hierarchical group relationships

The view binds to a ViewModel for data handling and validation, supporting both new group creation and existing group editing.
