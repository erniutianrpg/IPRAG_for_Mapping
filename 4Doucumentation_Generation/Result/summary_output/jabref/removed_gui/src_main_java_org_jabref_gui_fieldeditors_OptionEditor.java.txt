The `OptionEditor` class is a JavaFX-based dropdown combobox field editor for BibTeX entries in JabRef. It displays predefined options from a view model (`OptionEditorViewModel`), binds the selected value to an entry's field, and provides a context menu with default editor actions. The editor converts between display text and model values, updates the UI when the underlying entry changes, and integrates with JabRef's global preferences.
