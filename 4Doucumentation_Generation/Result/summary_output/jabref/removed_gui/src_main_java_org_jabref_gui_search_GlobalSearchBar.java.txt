The `GlobalSearchBar` class implements a search bar component for JabRef, a reference management software. It provides: 

- A text field for search queries with auto-completion for authors
- Toggle buttons for search modifiers (case-sensitive, regex, fulltext)
- Search history tracking
- Validation for regex queries
- Real-time search results display
- Support for global searches across libraries
- Keyboard shortcuts and tooltips

The component manages search preferences, performs searches with a 400ms delay, and updates results dynamically. It integrates with JabRef's state management and undo system.
