The `Theme` class manages CSS-based themes for JabRef, supporting three types: DEFAULT (light theme), EMBEDDED (dark theme), and CUSTOM (user-provided CSS). It stores the theme type, name, and optional stylesheet. The class provides static methods (`light()`, `dark()`, `custom()`) to create themes, and getters for type, name, and stylesheet. It ensures non-null values and includes proper equality checks, hash code, and string representation. The DEFAULT theme has no stylesheet, while EMBEDDED and CUSTOM themes load their respective CSS files.
