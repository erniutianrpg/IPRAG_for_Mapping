The `CellFactory` class maps various bibliographic fields (like PDF, URL, DOI) to corresponding icons for display in a table. It initializes a map (`TABLE_ICONS`) associating each field with an icon from `IconTheme` or external file types. Special fields (e.g., relevance, quality) are also mapped to icons via `SpecialFieldViewModel`. The `getTableIcon` method retrieves the icon for a given field as a JavaFX `Node` for rendering. This class essentially handles the visual representation of field types in a table UI.
