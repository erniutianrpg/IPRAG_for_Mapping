This JavaFX dialog allows users to manage keywords for BibTeX entries in JabRef. It displays keywords in a table with options to edit or delete them. The dialog binds to a view model (`ManageKeywordsViewModel`) that handles the logic for saving changes, removing keywords, and tracking display preferences. Users can apply changes or cancel, with edits saved only when "Apply" is clicked. The interface includes edit and delete buttons for each keyword.
