This code implements a `Comparator` for `Optional<SpecialFieldValueViewModel>` objects. It compares two Optional values: if both contain values, it compares their inner `SpecialFieldValueViewModel` values; if only one has a value, that one is considered greater; if both are empty, they are considered equal. This enables sorting of Optional special field values in collections. (98 words)
