The `AboutDialogViewModel` class manages the "About" dialog functionality for JabRef, a reference management software. It displays version information, maintainers, license details, and system environment data. The class provides methods to copy version info to clipboard and open various external URLs (homepage, GitHub, changelog, license, contributors, donations) in a browser. It differentiates between development and release versions and handles errors when opening websites. The view model uses JavaFX properties for data binding with the UI.
