The code defines a simple Java enum `GroupViewMode` with two possible values: `INTERSECTION` and `UNION`. This enum is likely used to specify how groups should be combined or displayed in the JabRef application, either showing the intersection (common elements) or union (all elements) of groups. The enum provides a type-safe way to handle these two grouping modes.
