The `BackgroundTask` class is a wrapper around JavaFX's `Task` that provides a fluid interface for managing background operations. It supports progress tracking, cancellation, and callbacks for success, failure, and completion. The class allows chaining tasks, updating progress/messages, and customizing behavior (e.g., showing to users or automatic recovery). It simplifies asynchronous task execution while avoiding direct JavaFX thread updates for easier testing. Key features include progress monitoring, task composition via `then`/`thenRun`, and configurable event handlers.
