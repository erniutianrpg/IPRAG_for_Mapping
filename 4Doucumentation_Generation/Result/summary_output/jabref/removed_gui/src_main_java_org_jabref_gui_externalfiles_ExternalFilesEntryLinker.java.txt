The `ExternalFilesEntryLinker` class manages file operations for BibTeX entries in JabRef. It handles copying/moving files to a specified directory, renaming files according to patterns, and linking them to entries. Key functionalities include: copying files to the file directory (`copyFileToFileDir`), renaming/moving linked files (`renameLinkedFilesToPattern`, `moveLinkedFilesToFileDir`), adding files to entries (`addFilesToEntry`), and combined operations that also update the PDF index (`moveFilesToFileDirAndAddToEntry`, `copyFilesToFileDirAndAddToEntry`). It uses preferences and database context for file management.
