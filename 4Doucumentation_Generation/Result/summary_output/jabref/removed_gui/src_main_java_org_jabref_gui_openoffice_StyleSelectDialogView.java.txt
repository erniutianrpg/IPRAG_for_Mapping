The `StyleSelectDialogView` is a JavaFX dialog for selecting and managing citation styles in JabRef. It displays a table of available styles with their properties, allows previewing how articles and books would appear with each style, and provides options to add, edit, reload, or delete styles. The dialog returns the selected style when confirmed. It uses a view-model pattern for data management and integrates with JabRef's preferences and theme systems.
