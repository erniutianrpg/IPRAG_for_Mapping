The `MergedFieldCell` class extends `ThreeWayMergeCell` to create a styled text area for displaying and editing merged field content in a JavaFX UI. It initializes a rich text area (`StyleClassedTextArea`) with bidirectional binding to sync text properties, enables text wrapping, auto-height, padding, and horizontal growth. Scroll events are filtered and redirected to the parent cell. The cell is designed for use in a three-way merge interface, typically for comparing and merging text fields.
