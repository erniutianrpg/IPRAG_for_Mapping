The `GenderEditorViewModel` class is a field editor for gender-related entries in JabRef. It maps short gender codes (like "sf", "sm") to their localized display names (e.g., "Female name", "Male name") using a bidirectional map. It extends `MapBasedEditorViewModel` to provide these gender options for selection in the UI, while supporting autocompletion and field validation. The `convertToDisplayText` method simply returns the input string as-is for display.
