This code defines a custom annotation `@AllowedToUseStandardStreams` in Java, which marks classes that are permitted to use standard output streams (`System.out`) instead of a logging framework. The annotation includes a mandatory `value` field to provide the rationale for this exception. In essence, it serves as documentation for deviating from standard logging practices.
