The `FileHistoryMenu` class creates a JavaFX menu displaying recently opened library files from a `FileHistory`. It allows users to: 
1. Open files by clicking menu items or using keyboard shortcuts (numbers 1-9).
2. Add new files to the history, moving existing entries to the top.
3. Handle missing files by showing an error and removing them from history. 
4. Disable the menu when empty. The menu items show file paths with numbered prefixes and prevent mnemonic parsing issues with underscores.
