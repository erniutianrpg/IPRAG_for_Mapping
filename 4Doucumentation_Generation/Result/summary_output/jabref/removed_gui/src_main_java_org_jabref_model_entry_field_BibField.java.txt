The `BibField` class is a record that encapsulates a `Field` and its priority (`FieldPriority`). It overrides `equals()` and `hashCode()` to compare fields case-insensitively by name, provides a string representation via `toString()`, and implements `Comparable` to enable sorting by field name. The class ensures field name equality is case-insensitive while maintaining consistent hashing and comparison. (98 words)
