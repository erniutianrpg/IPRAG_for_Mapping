This code provides utility methods for filtering and sorting files based on their last modified dates. Key functionalities include:
1. Getting a file's last modified time as `LocalDateTime`
2. Checking if a file was modified within specific time ranges (day, week, month, year)
3. Filtering files by date range using an enum (`DateRange`)
4. Sorting file paths by modification date in ascending or descending order
5. A general sorting method that delegates to specific sorters based on an enum (`ExternalFileSorter`)

The class helps manage file operations with date-based filtering and sorting capabilities.
