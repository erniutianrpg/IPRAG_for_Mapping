The `SourceTab` class in JabRef provides a tab for viewing and editing BibTeX entry sources directly. It features:

1. A code editor with syntax highlighting, undo/redo, and search functionality
2. Validation of BibTeX syntax
3. Conversion between UI edits and BibTeX source
4. Keyboard shortcuts for common actions (copy, paste, save)
5. Integration with JabRef's undo manager and database system
6. Error handling for invalid BibTeX syntax

The tab synchronizes between the formatted entry view and raw BibTeX source, ensuring changes in one are reflected in the other while maintaining valid BibTeX syntax.
