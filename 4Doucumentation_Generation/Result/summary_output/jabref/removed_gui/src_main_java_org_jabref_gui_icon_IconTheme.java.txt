This code defines an `IconTheme` class for managing icons in a JavaFX application (JabRef). It provides:

1. Icon loading from resource files and Material Design icons
2. Color customization for icons
3. Default and disabled icon states
4. Utility methods to get icon URLs and images
5. An enum (`JabRefIcons`) with 100+ predefined icons for various actions
6. Support for creating icon-based buttons and toggle buttons

The class handles icon lookup, loading, and rendering while providing fallback options when icons are missing. It uses the Ikonli library for Material Design icons and manages a mapping between icon names and their resource paths.
