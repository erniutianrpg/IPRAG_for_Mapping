The `MoveFieldValueAction` class moves field values between specified fields (`fromField` to `toField`) in a list of `BibEntry` entries. It optionally overwrites the target field's content if `overwriteToFieldContent` is true or if the target is empty. The action tracks changes for undo functionality via `NamedCompound` and counts affected entries. The `execute()` method performs the move, while `executeAndGetAffectedEntriesCount()` returns the count of modified entries.
