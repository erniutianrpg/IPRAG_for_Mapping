The `JabRefIcon` interface defines methods for working with icons in a JavaFX application. It provides functionality to get the icon as a graphical node (`getGraphicNode`), retrieve its name (`name`), customize its color (`withColor`), create a disabled version (`disabled`), and access its underlying `Ikon` representation (`getIkon`). This interface serves as a base for implementing customizable and interactive icons in the JabRef GUI. (98 words)
