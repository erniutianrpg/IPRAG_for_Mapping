The `AutoLinkFilesAction` class is a command that automatically links associated files to selected BibTeX entries. It checks for file availability, updates the entries with file links, and handles errors or no-file-found scenarios. The action is only executable when entries are selected in a database. It runs as a background task, shows progress dialogs, and supports undo functionality. Success or failure messages are displayed to the user, along with the number of modified entries.
