This code defines an enum `AutoCompleteFirstNameMode` that controls how first names are displayed in an auto-completer: showing full names (`ONLY_FULL`), abbreviated first names (`ONLY_ABBREVIATED`), or both (`BOTH`). The `parse` method converts a string input to the corresponding enum value, defaulting to `BOTH` if the input is invalid. This helps manage name display preferences in an auto-completion feature.
