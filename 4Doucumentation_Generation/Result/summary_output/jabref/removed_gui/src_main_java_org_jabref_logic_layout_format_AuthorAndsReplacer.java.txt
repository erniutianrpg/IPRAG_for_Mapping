The `AuthorAndsReplacer` class formats author lists in BibTeX entries. It replaces " and " separators with " & " for two authors, and with semicolons followed by " & " for the last two authors in lists with three or more authors. For example: "A and B" becomes "A & B", while "A and B and C" becomes "A; B & C". The input is split by " and ", then rejoined with appropriate separators based on the number of authors.
