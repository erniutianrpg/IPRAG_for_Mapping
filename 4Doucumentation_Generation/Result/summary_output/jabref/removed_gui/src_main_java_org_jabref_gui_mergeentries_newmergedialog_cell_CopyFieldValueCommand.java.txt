The `CopyFieldValueCommand` class is a command that copies a given field value to the system clipboard. It takes a `fieldValue` string (which cannot be null) and a `PreferencesService` in its constructor. When executed via the `execute()` method, it uses a `ClipBoardManager` to set the clipboard's content to the provided `fieldValue`. This enables easy copying of field values in the application.
