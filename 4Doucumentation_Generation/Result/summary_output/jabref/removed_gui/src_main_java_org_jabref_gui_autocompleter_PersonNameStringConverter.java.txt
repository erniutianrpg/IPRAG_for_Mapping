The `PersonNameStringConverter` class converts `Author` objects to formatted strings for autocompletion based on preferences. It supports different name formats (first-last, last-first, or both) and firstName modes (abbreviated, full, or both). The `toString` method formats author names according to these preferences, while `fromString` parses a string back into an `Author` object. This is used in JabRef's autocompletion functionality for author names in bibliography entries.
