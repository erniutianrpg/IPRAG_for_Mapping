The `DiffHighlightingTextPane` class extends JavaFX's `TextFlow` to create a component for displaying text differences with visual styling. It defines CSS styles for additions (blue/underlined), deletions (red/strikethrough), and changes (dark green/underlined), though the actual styling implementation is currently commented out. The component appears designed to highlight text changes in a diff-like view, but the HTML rendering functionality is disabled in the current code.
