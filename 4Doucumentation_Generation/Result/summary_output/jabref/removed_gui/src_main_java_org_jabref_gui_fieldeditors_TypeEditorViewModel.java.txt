The `TypeEditorViewModel` class is a specialized editor for document types in JabRef, mapping short type codes (e.g., "phdthesis") to localized display names (e.g., "PhD thesis"). It extends `MapBasedEditorViewModel` and initializes a bidirectional map (`BiMap`) with 8 common document types. The class provides methods to access this mapping and convert stored values to display text, ensuring integrity checks and autocompletion support via its parent class. Essentially, it manages the display and selection of document types in a user-friendly way.
