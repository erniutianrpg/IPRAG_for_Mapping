The `ThreeWayMergeViewModel` class manages a three-way merge interface for BibTeX entries. It maintains left, right, and merged BibEntry objects, along with their headers. The class combines fields from both entries, excludes internal fields, sorts them, and ensures the entry type field appears first. It provides properties for UI binding and methods to access/modify entries and headers. The view model facilitates comparing and merging two BibTeX entries in a GUI context.
