This code implements context menu actions (Cut, Copy, Paste, Delete, Select All) for text input controls in a JavaFX application. It checks conditions like editability, text selection, and clipboard content to enable/disable menu items dynamically. The `EditorContextAction` class handles command execution (like copying selected text), while `getDefaultContextMenuItems` creates the menu items with appropriate bindings and keyboard shortcuts. Special handling is included for touch devices and password fields.
