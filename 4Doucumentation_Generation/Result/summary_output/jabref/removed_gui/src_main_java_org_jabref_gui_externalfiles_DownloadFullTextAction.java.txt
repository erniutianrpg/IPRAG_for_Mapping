This code implements a feature in JabRef to download full-text PDFs for selected bibliography entries by following their URLs or DOIs. It checks if entries are selected, warns when downloading many files, searches for PDFs using full-text fetchers, and downloads/links found files to the entries. The process includes progress tracking, error handling, and checks for existing files to avoid duplicates. The download occurs in a background task to maintain UI responsiveness.
