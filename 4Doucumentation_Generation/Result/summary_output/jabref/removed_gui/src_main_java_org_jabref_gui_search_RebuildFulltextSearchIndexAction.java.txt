This code defines a `RebuildFulltextSearchIndexAction` class that rebuilds the full-text search index for a library in JabRef. It checks if a database is active, prompts the user for confirmation, and then uses a background task to recreate and update the PDF search index. If the operation fails, it displays an error message. The action is only executable when a database is open. The process involves initializing the context, confirming with the user, and handling potential IO exceptions during index rebuilding.
