This JavaFX code implements a dialog for connecting to a shared database in JabRef. It provides UI fields for database connection details (type, host, port, credentials), SSL options, and autosave preferences. The dialog validates user input, binds UI elements to a view model, and handles connection attempts. Upon successful connection, it closes. The code also includes file browsing for keystore and database save locations, with dynamic UI updates based on user selections (like SSL or autosave toggles).
