The `MergeTwoEntriesAction` class merges two BibTeX entries in JabRef. It takes an `EntriesMergeResult` (containing original and merged entries) and a `StateManager` (for database access). When executed, it inserts the merged entry into the active database, removes the original entries, and records these changes as an undoable operation. The action is skipped if no database is active. The undo history is updated to allow reverting the merge.
