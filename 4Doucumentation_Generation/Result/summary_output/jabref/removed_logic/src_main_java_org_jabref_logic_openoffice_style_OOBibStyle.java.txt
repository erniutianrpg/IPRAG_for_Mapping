The `OOBibStyle` class handles bibliography and citation formatting for OpenOffice/LibreOffice documents. It reads style files to configure citation markers (numeric or author-year), bibliography entry layouts, and formatting properties like italics/bold text. The class manages journal names, field formatting, and citation grouping, providing methods to generate formatted citations and bibliography entries based on the loaded style rules. It supports both file-based and resource-based style definitions with properties for customization.
