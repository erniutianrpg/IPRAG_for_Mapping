The `LogMessages` class is a singleton that maintains an observable list of log entries (`LogEntry`) for JabRef. It provides methods to add new log entries (`add`), clear all entries (`clear`), and retrieve an unmodifiable view of the logs (`getMessages`). The class follows the singleton pattern, ensuring only one instance exists, accessible via `getInstance()`. This allows centralized logging and observation of log messages throughout the application.
