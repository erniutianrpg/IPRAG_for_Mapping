This code provides functionality to index PDF files linked to BibTeX entries for search purposes using Apache Lucene. It reads PDF content, annotations, and metadata (like modification time) from each page of the PDF, processes the text (merging hyphenated line breaks), and creates Lucene documents for each page. The documents store the content, annotations, and metadata, enabling efficient text search within PDFs linked to bibliography entries. The class handles file paths using user preferences and validates input data.
