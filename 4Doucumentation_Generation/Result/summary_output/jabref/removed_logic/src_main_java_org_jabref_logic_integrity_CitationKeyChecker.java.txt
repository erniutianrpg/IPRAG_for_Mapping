The `CitationKeyChecker` class verifies if a BibTeX entry has a valid citation key. It checks that the entry contains author, title, and year fields; if any are missing, it returns no errors. If these fields exist but the citation key is empty, it generates an integrity message indicating the missing key along with the entry's author-title-year information. This ensures citation keys are present when required fields exist.
