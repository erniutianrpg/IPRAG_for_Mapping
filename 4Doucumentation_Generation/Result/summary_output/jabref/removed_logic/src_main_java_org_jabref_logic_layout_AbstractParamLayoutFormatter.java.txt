This abstract class `AbstractParamLayoutFormatter` provides a method `parseArgument` to split an input string into parts separated by commas (`,`), while handling escaped characters. Backslashes (`\`) escape commas, quotes (`"`), and special characters (`n` for newline, `t` for tab). Non-escaped backslashes are treated literally. The parsed parts are returned as a list of strings. This functionality supports formatted argument parsing in layout operations.
