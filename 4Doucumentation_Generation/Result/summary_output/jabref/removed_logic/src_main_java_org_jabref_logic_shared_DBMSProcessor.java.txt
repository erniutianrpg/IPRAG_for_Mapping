The `DBMSProcessor` class is an abstract base class that handles communication between JabRef and a SQL database for shared bibliography management. It provides core functionality for:

1. Database integrity checks and setup
2. CRUD operations for BibTeX entries (insert, update, delete, retrieve)
3. Metadata management
4. Version control and conflict detection
5. Database-specific query escaping

The class supports multiple DBMS types (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle) through concrete subclasses. It manages synchronization of bibliography entries between multiple clients while handling potential conflicts through version tracking. The processor also includes methods for table creation, field management, and batch operations.
