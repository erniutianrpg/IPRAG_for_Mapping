The `BibEntryTypesManager` class manages BibTeX and Biblatex entry types, handling standard and custom/modified types. It provides methods to:
1. Retrieve all custom types for a given database mode (BibTeX/Biblatex)
2. Check if a type is custom or modified
3. Add, remove, or clear custom/modified types
4. Enrich entry types with additional information
5. Compare types for differences

The class internally separates standard types from custom/modified ones and offers operations to manage them based on the database mode. It serves as a central point for entry type management in a bibliography database.
