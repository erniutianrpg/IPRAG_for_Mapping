The `ProgressInputStream` class extends `FilterInputStream` to track and report progress while reading bytes from an input stream. It maintains properties for the total bytes read (`totalNumBytesRead`) and progress percentage (`progress`), calculated against a maximum byte count (`maxNumBytes`). The class overrides `read()`, `read(byte[], int, int)`, and `skip()` methods to update progress after each operation. It disables mark/reset functionality. Useful for monitoring download/read progress in JavaFX applications. (98 words)
