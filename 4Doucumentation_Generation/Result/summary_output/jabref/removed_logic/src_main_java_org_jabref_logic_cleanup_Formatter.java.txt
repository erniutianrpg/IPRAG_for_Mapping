The `Formatter` abstract class defines a template for text formatting operations in JabRef. It requires implementing classes to provide: a name, unique key, formatting logic, description, and example input. The formatter uses the key for identity (via `equals()` and `hashCode()`). Its core function is transforming input strings (e.g., "John von Neumann" â†’ "von Neumann, John"). This serves as a base for specific formatters in a Filter pattern, ensuring consistent behavior across implementations.
