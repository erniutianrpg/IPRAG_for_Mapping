This code exports BibTeX entries to an OpenDocument Spreadsheet (ODS) format. It creates a ZIP file containing XML content (converted from BibTeX entries) along with required ODS files like `mimetype`, `meta.xml`, and `manifest.xml`. The process involves: 
1. Converting entries to XML via `OpenDocumentRepresentation`
2. Storing XML in a temp file
3. Packaging all files into a ZIP with proper ODS structure
4. Cleaning up the temp file. The exporter only runs if there are entries to process.
