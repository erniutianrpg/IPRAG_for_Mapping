The `Authors` class is a versatile author name formatter that formats author lists based on customizable parameters. It supports different name orderings (FirstFirst, LastFirst), abbreviation styles (initials, full names), separators (comma, and), punctuation options, and handling of long author lists (et al.). The formatter parses input arguments to configure these options and processes author names accordingly, producing formatted strings for bibliographic entries. Key features include flexible name ordering, abbreviation control, and customizable separators between names.
