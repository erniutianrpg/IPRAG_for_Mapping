The `EntryChecker` interface defines a functional method `check` that takes a `BibEntry` and returns a list of `IntegrityMessage` objects. It serves as a contract for checking the integrity of bibliography entries, allowing implementations to validate entries and report any issues through integrity messages. Being a functional interface, it can be implemented with lambda expressions or method references.
