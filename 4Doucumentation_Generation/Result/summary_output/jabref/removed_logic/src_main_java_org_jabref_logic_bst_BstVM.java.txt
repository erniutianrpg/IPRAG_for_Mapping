The `BstVM` class is a BibTeX style (BST) virtual machine that processes BST files to format BibTeX entries into rendered references. It uses ANTLR for parsing BST files and provides methods to transform collections of `BibEntry` objects into formatted text output. The class handles parsing errors, manages a context for execution, and supports built-in BST functions. The main `render` method processes entries using the parsed BST rules and returns the formatted references as a string.
