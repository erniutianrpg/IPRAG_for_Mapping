The `RemoveDigitsFormatter` class removes all digits from a given string. It implements the `Formatter` interface, providing methods for name, key, description, and example. The `format` method uses a regex pattern to match and remove digits (preceded by a space) from the input string. For example, "In 012 CDMA" becomes "In CDMA". This formatter is part of a BibTeX field cleanup utility. (94 words)
