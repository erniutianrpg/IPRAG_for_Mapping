The `XmpUtilShared` class provides utility methods for handling XMP metadata in PDFs within the JabRef application. It includes a method to parse XMP metadata from an input stream (`parseXmpMetadata`) and another to check if a PDF contains XMP metadata (`hasMetadata`). The latter reads metadata using `XmpUtilReader` and returns `true` if BibTeX entries are found, handling exceptions for encrypted PDFs or I/O errors. The class serves as a shared helper for XMP metadata operations.
