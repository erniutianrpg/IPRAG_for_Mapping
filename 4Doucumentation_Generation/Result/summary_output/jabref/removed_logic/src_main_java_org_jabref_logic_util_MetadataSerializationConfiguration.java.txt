This code defines constants for metadata serialization in JabRef, specifying identifiers for different group types (like keyword groups, search groups, etc.) and configuration parameters (quote character, unit separator) used when reading/writing metadata. It serves as a configuration class for group-related serialization formats, with static fields identifying each group type and serialization syntax rules. The private constructor prevents instantiation. (98 words)
