This code defines a `NamedRangeManagerReferenceMark` class that implements the `NamedRangeManager` interface for managing named ranges (reference marks) in an OpenOffice document. It provides three main functions:  
1. `createNamedRange`: Creates a named range at a specified cursor position.  
2. `getUsedNames`: Retrieves a list of all named ranges in the document.  
3. `getNamedRangeFromDocument`: Fetches a specific named range by its name.  

The class handles exceptions like missing documents or creation failures and interacts with OpenOffice's UNO API. (98 words)
