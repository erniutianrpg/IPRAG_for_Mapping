The `WebViewStore` class manages a pool of preloaded JavaFX `WebView` instances to prevent UI freezes during instantiation. It initializes with a configurable number of preloaded instances (default: 4) and maintains a minimum threshold (default: 2). When a `WebView` is requested via `get()`, it returns a preloaded instance if available or creates a new one. If the pool size falls below the minimum threshold, it asynchronously adds new instances. The store must be initialized at application startup. This improves performance by avoiding synchronous `WebView` creation on the UI thread.
