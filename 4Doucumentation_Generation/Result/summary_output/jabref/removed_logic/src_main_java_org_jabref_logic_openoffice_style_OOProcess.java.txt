This code provides functionality for generating and sorting citation markers in OpenOffice documents. It defines two comparators (`AUTHOR_YEAR_TITLE` and `YEAR_AUTHOR_TITLE`) for sorting BibTeX entries, and selects between them based on style settings. The main method `produceCitationMarkers` generates citation markers in different formats (citation key, numeric, or author-year) depending on the specified style, after ensuring proper ordering of citations. The class is part of JabRef's OpenOffice integration for bibliography management.
