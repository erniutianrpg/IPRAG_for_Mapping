The `SpringerQueryTransformer` class converts Lucene syntax queries into Springer-compatible queries. It supports fielded searches (author, title, journal) and boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT). The class transforms author, title, and journal fields into key-value pairs (e.g., "name:author") and formats year queries with a wildcard (e.g., "date:2023*"). It inherits from `AbstractQueryTransformer` and overrides methods to specify the logical operators (`AND`, `OR`, `-` for NOT) and field handling. The transformation is limited to basic boolean AND operations.
