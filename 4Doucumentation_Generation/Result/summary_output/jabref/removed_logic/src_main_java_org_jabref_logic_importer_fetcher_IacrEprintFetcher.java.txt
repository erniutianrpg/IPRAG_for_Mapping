The `IacrEprintFetcher` class fetches bibliographic entries and fulltext PDFs from the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR) eprint archive. It validates identifiers (e.g., "2024/123"), retrieves BibTeX entries, abstracts, dates, and version information from IACR's website. For entries after 2000, it also fetches version details. The class implements `FulltextFetcher` and `IdBasedFetcher` interfaces, supporting fulltext PDF URL retrieval and identifier-based searches. Error handling includes invalid identifiers or missing data. Trust level is set as "PREPRINT."
