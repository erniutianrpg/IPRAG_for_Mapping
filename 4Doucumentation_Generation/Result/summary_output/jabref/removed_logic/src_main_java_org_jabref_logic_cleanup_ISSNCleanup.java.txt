The `ISSNCleanup` class implements a cleanup job for BibTeX entries. It checks if an entry has an ISSN (International Standard Serial Number) field, validates and cleans up the ISSN format if necessary. If the ISSN can be cleaned (e.g., by correcting formatting), it updates the field and returns a `FieldChange` object documenting the modification. If no cleanup is needed or the field is absent, it returns an empty list. This ensures standardized ISSN formatting in bibliography entries.
