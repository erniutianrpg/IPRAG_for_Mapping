This code defines a formatter (`AuthorLF_FF`) for author names in BibTeX entries. It takes a string of authors, parses it into an `AuthorList`, and formats the names in "LastFirst, FirstLast" order (e.g., "Doe, John and Smith, Jane") without using Oxford commas. The formatted string is returned for use in bibliography layouts.
