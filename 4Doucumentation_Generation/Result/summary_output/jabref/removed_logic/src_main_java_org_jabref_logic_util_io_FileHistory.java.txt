The `FileHistory` class maintains a fixed-size (8 items) observable list of recently used file paths. It extends `ModifiableObservableListBase` to provide observable list functionality. Key features include: adding/moving files to the top of the list (`newFile()`), removing items (`removeItem()`), and maintaining history size by removing oldest entries when exceeded. The list is initialized from a provided list of paths. It provides standard list operations (get, add, set, remove) through overridden methods that delegate to an underlying `ArrayList<Path>`.
