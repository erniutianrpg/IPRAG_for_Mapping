The `DocBookAuthorFormatter` class formats author names into DocBook XML (versions 4 or 5) by processing an `AuthorList`. For each author, it structures their first name, von part, last name, and suffix into appropriate XML tags (`<firstname>`, `<othername>`, `<surname>`). In DocBook 5, it wraps these in a `<personname>` tag. The output is appended to a `StringBuilder`, with proper XML escaping for special characters. The formatter handles both author and editor fields, differentiating them via the `tagName` parameter.
