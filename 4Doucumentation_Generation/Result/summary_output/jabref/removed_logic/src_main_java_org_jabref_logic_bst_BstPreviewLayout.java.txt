The `BstPreviewLayout` class generates formatted previews of BibTeX entries using a BST (BibTeX Style) file. It loads the BST file via `BstVM`, processes the entry to ensure BibTeX format, then applies multiple cleanup steps: removing LaTeX commands, comments, and special formatting, converting LaTeX to Unicode, and normalizing whitespace. Error handling is included for file access issues. The preview is returned as a cleaned, readable string. The class implements the `PreviewLayout` interface, providing methods to get the layout name and generate previews.
