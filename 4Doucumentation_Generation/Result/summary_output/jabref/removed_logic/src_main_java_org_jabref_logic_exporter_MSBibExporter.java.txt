The `MSBibExporter` class exports BibTeX entries to MS Office 2007's MSBIB XML format. It converts entries from a `BibDatabaseContext` into an XML DOM structure using `MSBibDatabase`, then writes the XML to a file with UTF-8 encoding. The output is formatted with indentation for readability. If the entries list is empty, it exits early. Errors during XML transformation or file writing are wrapped in a `SaveException`.
