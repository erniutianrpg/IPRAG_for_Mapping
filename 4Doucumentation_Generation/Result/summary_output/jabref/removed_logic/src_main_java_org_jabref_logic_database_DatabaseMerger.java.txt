The `DatabaseMerger` class merges two BibTeX databases (entries, strings, and metadata) while handling duplicates. For entries, it checks for duplicates before merging. For strings with conflicting content, it appends a suffix to create unique names. Metadata merging includes groups (renaming "AllEntriesGroup" to "Imported" for clarity) and content selectors. The class ensures data integrity by avoiding duplicates and resolving naming conflicts.
