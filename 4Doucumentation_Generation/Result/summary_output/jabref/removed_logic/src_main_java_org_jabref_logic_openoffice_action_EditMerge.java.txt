This code merges consecutive citation groups in an OpenOffice document when they are separated only by whitespace. It scans the document for adjacent citation groups of type `AUTHORYEAR_PAR`, combines their citations, removes the original groups, and creates a new merged citation group. The process ensures proper formatting and maintains document structure while handling potential errors. The main functionality is in `mergeCitationGroups()`, which coordinates scanning, merging, and updating the document. Helper methods manage group detection, validation, and cursor positioning.
