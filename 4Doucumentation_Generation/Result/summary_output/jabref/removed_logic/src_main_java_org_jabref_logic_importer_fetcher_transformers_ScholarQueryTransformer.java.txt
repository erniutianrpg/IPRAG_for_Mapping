The `ScholarQueryTransformer` class extends `YearAndYearRangeByFilteringQueryTransformer` to format search queries for Google Scholar. It overrides methods to specify logical operators (`AND`, `OR`, `-`) and formats author, title, and journal fields into key-value pairs for the query URL (e.g., `author:name`, `allintitle:title`, `source:journal`). It also tracks start and end years for query parameters but doesn't implement their URL integration in this snippet. The class adapts general search terms into Scholar-specific query syntax.
