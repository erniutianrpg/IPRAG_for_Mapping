The `IsbnFetcher` class fetches BibTeX entries using ISBN numbers. It primarily uses `OpenLibraryIsbnFetcher` but supports fallback fetchers via `addRetryFetcher()`. The `performSearchById()` method cleans the ISBN, queries the primary fetcher, and falls back to alternatives if needed. It also handles `EntryBasedFetcher` by extracting ISBNs from BibEntries. The class ensures robust ISBN lookup with error handling and logging. (98 words)
