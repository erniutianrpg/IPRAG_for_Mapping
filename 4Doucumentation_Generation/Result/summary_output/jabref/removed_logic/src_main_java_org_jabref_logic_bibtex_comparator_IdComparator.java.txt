The `IdComparator` class implements a `Comparator` for `BibEntry` objects, sorting them based on their lexicographical ID order. This allows entries to be sorted chronologically if their IDs are assigned in increasing order. The `compare` method simply compares the IDs of two entries using their natural string ordering.
