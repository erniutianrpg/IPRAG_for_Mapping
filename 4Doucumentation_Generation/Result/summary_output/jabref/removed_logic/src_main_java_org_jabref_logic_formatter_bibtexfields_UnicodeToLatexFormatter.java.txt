This code converts Unicode characters in a given text to their LaTeX equivalents. It handles standard symbols using a predefined map (UNICODE_LATEX_CONVERSION_MAP) and processes combining accents separately. Any unconverted Unicode characters (code points â‰¥129) trigger a warning. The formatter is part of the JabRef logic for BibTeX field cleanup and implements both Formatter and LayoutFormatter interfaces, providing metadata like description, example, and name. The main functionality is in the `format()` method which performs the conversion.
