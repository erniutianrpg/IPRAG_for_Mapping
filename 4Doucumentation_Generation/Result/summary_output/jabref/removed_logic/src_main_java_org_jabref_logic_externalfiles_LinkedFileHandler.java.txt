The `LinkedFileHandler` class manages file operations for PDFs or other files linked to BibTeX entries in JabRef. It provides functionality to:

1. Move linked files to a default directory (with optional subdirectory patterns)
2. Rename files based on naming patterns (handling case sensitivity and overwrites)
3. Suggest valid filenames based on entry metadata
4. Check for existing files with case-insensitive comparison

The class uses the database context and user preferences to determine file locations and naming conventions while maintaining relative paths in the BibTeX entry.
