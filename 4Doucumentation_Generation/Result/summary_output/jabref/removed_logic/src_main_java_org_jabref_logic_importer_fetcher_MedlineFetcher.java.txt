The `MedlineFetcher` class fetches bibliographic entries from the PubMed database. It implements both ID-based and search-based fetching. For searches, it transforms Lucene queries into PubMed-compatible queries, retrieves matching PubMed IDs, and then fetches the corresponding entries in Medline XML format. The fetcher handles up to 50 results by default, performs post-fetch cleanup (e.g., normalizing authors and months), and returns the results as `BibEntry` objects. Errors during fetching or parsing are logged and handled gracefully.
