This code implements a fetcher for the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) API. It allows searching for bibliographic entries by query, identifier (bibcode/DOI), or BibEntry fields (title/author). The fetcher retrieves results in BibTeX format, performs post-processing cleanup on fields (abstract, title, author, etc.), and handles pagination. It supports API key authentication and transforms Lucene queries into ADS-compatible search requests. The class implements multiple fetcher interfaces (IdBased, PagedSearchBased, EntryBased) to provide versatile search capabilities for academic references in astrophysics.
