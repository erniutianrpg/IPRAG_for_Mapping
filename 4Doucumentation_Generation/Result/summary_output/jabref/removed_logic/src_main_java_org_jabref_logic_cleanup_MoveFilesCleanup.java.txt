The `MoveFilesCleanup` class moves linked files of a BibTeX entry to a default directory specified in `FilePreferences`. For each file linked to a `BibEntry`, it uses `LinkedFileHandler` to relocate the file. If successful, it updates the entry's file links. Returns a list of changes if files were moved, or an empty list otherwise. Errors during file movement are logged. This cleanup operation is part of JabRef's file management system.
