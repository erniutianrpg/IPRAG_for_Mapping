The `DelayTaskThrottler` class throttles frequent tasks by delaying their execution. If a new task is scheduled before the previous one runs, the old task is canceled and replaced. Tasks are executed after a specified delay (in milliseconds), ensuring only the most recent task runs when multiple are triggered in quick succession. It uses a single-threaded executor to manage task scheduling and provides methods to cancel tasks, execute them immediately, or shut down the executor gracefully. This is useful for handling rapid-fire events where only the latest action matters.
