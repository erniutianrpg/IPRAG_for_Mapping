The `CoinsParser` class implements a parser for COinS (Context Objects in Spans) metadata, extracting bibliographic information from a URL-encoded string. It uses regular expressions to match and extract fields like DOI, title, journal, year, volume, pages, issue, and author(s) from the input stream. The parsed data is stored in a `BibEntry` object, with the entry type set based on the genre (e.g., "article" becomes `StandardEntryType.Article`). The parsed entry is returned as a singleton list. This parser is inspired by CiteSeerX's implementation.
