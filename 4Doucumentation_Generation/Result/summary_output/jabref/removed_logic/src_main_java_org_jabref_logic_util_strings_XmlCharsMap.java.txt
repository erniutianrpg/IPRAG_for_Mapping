The `XmlCharsMap` class is a specialized HashMap that maps LaTeX escape sequences for accented characters to their corresponding XML/HTML character entity references. For example, it converts sequences like `\"{a}` to `&#x00E4;` (ä) or `\~{n}` to `&#x00F1;` (ñ). This facilitates proper rendering of special characters when converting LaTeX-formatted text to XML/HTML. The map includes various accented characters for vowels and consonants with different diacritics (umlauts, graves, acutes, circumflexes, tildes).
