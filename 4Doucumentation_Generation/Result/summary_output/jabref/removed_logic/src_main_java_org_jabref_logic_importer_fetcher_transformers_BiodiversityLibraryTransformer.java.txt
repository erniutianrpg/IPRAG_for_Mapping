The `BiodiversityLibraryTransformer` class extends `AbstractQueryTransformer` to customize query transformations for the Biodiversity Library fetcher. It uses "+" as the operator for logical AND, OR, and NOT operations. The class provides simple pass-through handlers for author, title, journal, and year fields, returning them unchanged. This transformer is designed to format queries specifically for the Biodiversity Library's search syntax. (98 words)
