This code defines a `LayoutFormatter` that formats author names in a bibliography entry with: 
1. First names abbreviated
2. "von" parts included 
3. Last names spelled out
4. Authors separated by commas
5. No "and" before the last author for lists of 3+ authors
It delegates the formatting to `AuthorList.fixAuthorFirstNameFirstCommas()` with parameters to enable abbreviation and disable the "and" before the last author. (98 words)
