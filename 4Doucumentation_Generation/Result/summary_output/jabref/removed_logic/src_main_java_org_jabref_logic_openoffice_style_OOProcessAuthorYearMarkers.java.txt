This code handles author-year style citation markers in OpenOffice documents. It:

1. Creates normalized citation markers from citation keys using a specified style
2. Ensures uniqueness by adding letters (a, b) to duplicate citations
3. Tracks first appearances of citations 
4. Generates formatted citation markers (e.g., "(Smith 2020a, Jones 2021)") 
5. Processes citation groups to produce properly formatted in-text citations and bibliography entries

The main functionality is in `produceCitationMarkers()`, which coordinates these steps for author-year style citations (not numbered or key-based styles).
