The `LatexParser` interface defines methods to parse LaTeX files for bibliographic entries. It includes three methods: `parse(String)` for testing a citation string, `parse(Path)` for a single file, and `parse(List<Path>)` for multiple files. Each returns a `LatexParserResult` containing parsed citation data, with file paths and line numbers where applicable. The interface serves as a blueprint for LaTeX parsing functionality in JabRef.
