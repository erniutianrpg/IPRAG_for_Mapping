The `RelativePathsCleanup` class converts absolute file paths to relative paths for linked files in a BibTeX entry. It checks each file link, leaves online links unchanged, and transforms local file paths to relative paths based on the database's file directories. If changes occur, it updates the entry's file list and returns the changes. Otherwise, it returns an empty list. This helps maintain portable references to files relative to the database location.
