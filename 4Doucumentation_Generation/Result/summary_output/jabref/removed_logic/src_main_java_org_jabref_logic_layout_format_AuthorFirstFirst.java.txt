This code defines a `LayoutFormatter` implementation called `AuthorFirstFirst` that formats author names in "First First" order (first names followed by last names). It takes a string of author names (`fieldText`) and processes it using `AuthorList.fixAuthorFirstNameFirst()` to rearrange the names accordingly. The class is part of JabRef's logic for formatting bibliography entries. (98 words)
