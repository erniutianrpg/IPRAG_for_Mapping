This code converts author names from a BibTeX entry into BibORDF/XML format. It handles single authors directly and splits multiple authors (separated by " and ") into individual entries. Each author is wrapped in XML tags specifying their role as author, their name in FOAF format, and their position in the author list. The output follows a verbose BibORDF schema structure with proper indentation and line breaks. For example, "Author One and Author Two" becomes two separate `<bibo:contribution>` entries with positions 1 and 2.
