The `WrapFileLinks` class formats file links in a BibTeX entry according to a customizable pattern. It processes file links (optionally filtered by file type) and generates output based on escape sequences in the format string (like `\p` for file path, `\d` for description). It supports regex replacements for text manipulation and handles relative/absolute paths. The formatter iterates through file links, applies the specified format, and replaces placeholders with corresponding file metadata (e.g., index, path, type, extension, or description). This is useful for generating structured file listings in JabRef.
