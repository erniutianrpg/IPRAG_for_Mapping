This code defines an enum `DBMSType` that represents supported database systems (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle) in JabRef. For each DBMS, it stores the database name, JDBC driver class path, URL connection pattern, and default port. The enum provides methods to: get a DBMS type from a string, retrieve the driver class path, format a connection URL with host/port/database, and access the default port. Essentially, it encapsulates database connection details for JDBC operations. (98 words)
