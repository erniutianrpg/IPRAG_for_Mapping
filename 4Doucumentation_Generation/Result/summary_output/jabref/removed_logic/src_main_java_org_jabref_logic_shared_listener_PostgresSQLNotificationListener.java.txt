This code implements a PostgreSQL database notification listener that runs in a separate thread. It continuously checks for database notifications (every 500ms) and triggers synchronization (`pullChanges`) when relevant notifications are received, unless they originate from the current processor. The listener can be stopped via the `stop()` method. It's part of a system that synchronizes a JabRef bibliography database with a PostgreSQL backend, handling real-time updates. Errors during listening are logged.
