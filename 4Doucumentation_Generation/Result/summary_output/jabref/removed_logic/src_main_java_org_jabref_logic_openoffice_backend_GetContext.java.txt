This utility class provides a method `getCursorStringWithContext` that extracts text from an OpenOffice Writer cursor, including surrounding context characters. It expands the cursor's selection left and right by specified character counts (`charBefore` and `charAfter`), attempting to avoid splitting words. If `htmlMarkup` is true, it wraps the original cursor text in bold HTML tags. The method handles edge cases gracefully and returns the processed string trimmed of whitespace.
