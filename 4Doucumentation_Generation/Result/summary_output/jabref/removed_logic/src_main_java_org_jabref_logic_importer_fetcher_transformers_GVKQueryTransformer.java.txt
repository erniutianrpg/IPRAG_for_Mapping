The `GVKQueryTransformer` class transforms search queries into a format compatible with the GVK (Gemeinsamer Verbundkatalog) database. It extends `YearRangeByFilteringQueryTransformer` and handles various search fields (author, title, journal, year) by converting them into GVK-specific key-value pairs (e.g., `pica.tit=title`). It warns about unsupported Boolean operators (OR, NOT) and defaults to simple space separation. Unfielded terms and custom fields are also formatted as GVK-compatible queries. The logical AND operator is supported as `" and "`.
