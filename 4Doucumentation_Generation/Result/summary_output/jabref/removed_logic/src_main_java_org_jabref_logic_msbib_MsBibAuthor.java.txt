The `MsBibAuthor` class processes author information for MS BibTeX format. It extracts and stores an author's first, middle, and last names from a given `Author` object, splitting the first name into first and middle names. It provides methods to retrieve these names in different formats (e.g., "First Last" or "Last, First") and indicates if the author is a corporate entity. The class acts as an adapter between JabRef's `Author` model and MS BibTeX's author representation.
