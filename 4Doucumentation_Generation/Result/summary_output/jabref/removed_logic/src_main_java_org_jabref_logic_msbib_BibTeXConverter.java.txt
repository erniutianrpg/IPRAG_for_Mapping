The `BibTeXConverter` class converts an `MSBibEntry` (Microsoft BibTeX format) to a standard `BibEntry`. It maps fields like author, editor, journal, and pages between the formats, handles special cases like language conversion (LCID to language name), and parses standard numbers (ISBN, ISSN, etc.). It also processes author lists into BibTeX's "and"-separated format and preserves metadata like dates and conference names. The result is a `BibEntry` with all mapped fields populated.
