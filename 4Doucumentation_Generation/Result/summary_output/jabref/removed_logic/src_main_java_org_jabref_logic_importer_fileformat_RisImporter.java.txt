The `RisImporter` class is a Java importer for RIS (Research Information Systems) format files, commonly used for bibliographic data. It extends `Importer` to parse RIS files into BibTeX entries. Key functionalities include:

1. Recognizes RIS files by checking for "TY  - " pattern.
2. Parses various RIS tags (e.g., TY for entry type, AU for authors) and maps them to BibTeX fields.
3. Handles special cases like dates, DOIs, and multi-line values.
4. Converts RIS entry types to BibTeX types (e.g., JOUR â†’ Article).
5. Cleans and normalizes data (whitespace, author names).
6. Returns parsed entries as a `ParserResult` containing `BibEntry` objects.

The importer supports common bibliographic fields like title, journal, author, and publisher, with robust error handling for malformed data.
