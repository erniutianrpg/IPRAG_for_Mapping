This code extends `YearRangeByFilteringQueryTransformer` to handle year filtering on the client side when server-side filtering isn't supported. The `handleYear` method updates the earliest (`startYear`) and latest (`endYear`) years encountered during filtering, returning an empty string since the actual filtering occurs client-side. This enables JabRef to filter results by year range locally. (98 words)
