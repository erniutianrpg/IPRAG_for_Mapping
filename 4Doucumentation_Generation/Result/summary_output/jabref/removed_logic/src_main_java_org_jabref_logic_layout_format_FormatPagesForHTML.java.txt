The `FormatPagesForHTML` class implements a simple formatter that replaces double hyphens (`--`) with single hyphens (`-`) in a given string. This is likely used to clean up page number ranges (e.g., converting "123--125" to "123-125") for HTML display in the JabRef reference management software. The formatter implements the `LayoutFormatter` interface with a single `format` method.
