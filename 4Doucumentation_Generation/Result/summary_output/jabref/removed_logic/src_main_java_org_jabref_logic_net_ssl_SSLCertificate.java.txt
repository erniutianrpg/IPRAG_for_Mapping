The `SSLCertificate` class represents an SSL certificate with properties like serial number, issuer, validity dates, and SHA-256 thumbprint. It provides methods to create an `SSLCertificate` from an `X509Certificate` object or a file path, handling encoding and file errors. The class also includes getters for all certificate attributes and computes a hash of the DER-encoded certificate for identification.
