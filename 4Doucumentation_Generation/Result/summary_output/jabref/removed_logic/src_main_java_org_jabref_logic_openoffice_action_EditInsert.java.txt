This code handles citation insertion in OpenOffice documents for JabRef, a reference manager. It takes BibTeX entries, validates their citation keys, and creates formatted citation markers in the document. The `insertCitationGroup` method processes entries, looks them up in a database, formats them according to a specified style (numeric or author-year), and inserts them at the cursor position. It handles various exceptions and ensures proper screen refresh control during the operation. For numeric styles, it initially inserts a placeholder ("[-]") to be updated later.
