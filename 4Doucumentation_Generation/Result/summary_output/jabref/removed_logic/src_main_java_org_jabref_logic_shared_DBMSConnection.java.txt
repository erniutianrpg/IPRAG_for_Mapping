The `DBMSConnection` class manages database connections for JabRef. It validates connection properties, loads available database drivers, and establishes a connection using JDBC. The class provides methods to retrieve the active connection and its properties, and it can determine supported database types (`DBMSType`) by checking available drivers. Errors during connection are logged and propagated. The class ensures proper driver initialization before attempting connections.
