This code implements a `FulltextFetcher` that resolves DOI links to find full-text PDF URLs. It follows DOI redirects, checks for PDF links in HTML (including meta tags and embedded elements), and validates them. The fetcher uses custom or default DOI resolution bases, handles redirects, and scans for PDF indicators in links or text. It returns the PDF URL if found, prioritizing unique matches. Trust level is set to `SOURCE` for reliability.
