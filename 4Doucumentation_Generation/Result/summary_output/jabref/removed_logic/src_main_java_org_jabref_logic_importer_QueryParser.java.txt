The `QueryParser` class converts a Lucene syntax query string into a `ComplexSearchQuery`. It uses Lucene's `StandardQueryParser` to parse the query, extracts all search terms (ignoring boolean structure), sorts them alphabetically/numerically in reverse order, and constructs a `ComplexSearchQuery` from them. If parsing fails, it returns an empty `Optional`. Currently, it only supports fielded data and the AND operator.
