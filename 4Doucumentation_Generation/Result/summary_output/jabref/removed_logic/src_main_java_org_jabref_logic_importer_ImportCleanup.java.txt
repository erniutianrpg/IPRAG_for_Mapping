The `ImportCleanup` class converts BibTeX or BibLaTeX entries to a target format (specified during initialization). It provides two methods: `doPostCleanup(BibEntry)` for single entries and `doPostCleanup(Collection<BibEntry>)` for multiple entries. The conversion uses either `ConvertToBibtexCleanup` or `ConvertToBiblatexCleanup` based on the target format (`BibDatabaseMode`). The single-entry method returns the cleaned entry for stream compatibility.
