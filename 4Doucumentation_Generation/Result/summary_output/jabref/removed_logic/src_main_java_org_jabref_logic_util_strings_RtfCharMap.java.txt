The `RtfCharMap` class provides a mapping between special character sequences (like accented letters) and their RTF (Rich Text Format) code representations. It initializes a hashmap with these mappings during construction, covering various accented characters, symbols, and special characters. The class offers two main methods: `put()` to add mappings and `get()` to retrieve the RTF code for a given character sequence. This is useful for converting special characters to their RTF equivalents in text processing.
