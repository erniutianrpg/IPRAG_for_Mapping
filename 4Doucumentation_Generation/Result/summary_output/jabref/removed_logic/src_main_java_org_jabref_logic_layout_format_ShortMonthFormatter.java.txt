The `ShortMonthFormatter` class converts a month string (e.g., "January" or "1") into its abbreviated form (e.g., "Jan"). It implements the `LayoutFormatter` interface, parsing the input string into a `Month` object (if valid) and returning its short name. If parsing fails, it returns an empty string. This is useful for formatting month fields in a shortened style.
