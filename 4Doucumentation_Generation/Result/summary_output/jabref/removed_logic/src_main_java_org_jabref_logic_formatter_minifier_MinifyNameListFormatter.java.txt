The `MinifyNameListFormatter` class shortens lists of authors in bibliographic entries. If there are 3 or more authors, it replaces them with the first author followed by "and others" (e.g., "Author1 and Author2 and Author3" becomes "Author1 and others"). It handles edge cases like empty input, single authors, or already abbreviated lists. The formatter is part of JabRef's logic for cleaning up bibliography data.
