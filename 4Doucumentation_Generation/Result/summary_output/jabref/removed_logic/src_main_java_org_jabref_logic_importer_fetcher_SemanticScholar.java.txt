This code implements a `SemanticScholar` fetcher for JabRef that searches and retrieves academic papers from Semantic Scholar. It can:

1. Fetch fulltext PDFs using DOI or arXiv identifiers
2. Perform search queries and parse results into BibTeX entries
3. Convert JSON responses from the Semantic Scholar API into structured BibEntry objects
4. Handle pagination for search results

The class implements three interfaces: `FulltextFetcher` (for PDF retrieval), `PagedSearchBasedParserFetcher` (for search functionality), and `EntryBasedFetcher` (for lookup by BibEntry). It uses the Semantic Scholar API endpoints to query and retrieve paper metadata.
