The `GvkFetcher` class implements a search-based fetcher for the GVK (Gemeinsamer Verbundkatalog) database. It constructs a URL with query parameters to search the GVK SRU API, transforming Lucene queries using `GVKQueryTransformer`. The fetcher supports various search keys (like title, author) and returns results in PicaXML format, parsed by `PicaXmlParser`. It fetches up to 50 records sorted by year and provides help documentation.
