The `MSBibDatabase` class facilitates conversion between Microsoft Word's XML bibliography format and JabRef's BibTeX entries. It supports both import and export functionalities:

1. **Import**: Parses XML from a Word bibliography file (`importEntriesFromXml`) and converts it to BibTeX entries.
2. **Export**: Converts JabRef BibTeX entries (`addEntriesForExport`) to Word's XML format (`getDomForExport`).
3. Handles namespace-aware XML parsing and builds DOM trees for compatibility with Word's schema.

The class acts as a bridge between JabRef's database and Word's bibliography format.
