The `BackupManager` class handles automatic backups of a BibTeX database file whenever changes occur (`BibDatabaseContextChangedEvent`). It maintains up to 10 backup files, deleting older ones to manage space. Backups are written asynchronously using a scheduled executor to avoid performance issues. It provides methods to check for backup differences, restore from backups, and discard backups. The class ensures backups are atomic and handles encoding, file I/O, and error logging. It integrates with JabRef's preferences and database context for seamless operation.
