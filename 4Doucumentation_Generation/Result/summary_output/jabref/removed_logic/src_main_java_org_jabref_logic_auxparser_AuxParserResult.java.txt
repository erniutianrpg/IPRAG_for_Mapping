The `AuxParserResult` class tracks and manages data from parsing auxiliary (aux) files in JabRef. It stores references to a master bibliography database and maintains statistics about parsed entries, including unique citation keys, unresolved keys, cross-referenced entries, and nested aux files. It provides methods to access these statistics and the generated auxiliary database, as well as counters for crossrefs, nested files, and inserted strings. Essentially, it acts as a container for aux file parsing results and related metadata.
