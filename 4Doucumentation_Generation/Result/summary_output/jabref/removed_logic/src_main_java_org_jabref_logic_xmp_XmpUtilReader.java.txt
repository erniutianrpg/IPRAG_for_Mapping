This code provides functionality to read XMP metadata from PDF files using the PDFBox library. The main class `XmpUtilReader` can:

1. Extract raw XMP metadata from a PDF file (`readRawXmp`)
2. Convert XMP metadata (specifically Dublin Core schema) into BibTeX entries (`readXmp`)
3. Fall back to basic document information if no XMP metadata is found
4. Handle PDF decryption automatically
5. Parse multiple XMP descriptions from a single metadata block

The code is part of JabRef, a reference management software, and helps import bibliographic data from PDF metadata.
