This code converts plain text with paragraph breaks (two consecutive newlines) into HTML paragraphs. It wraps each paragraph in `<p>` tags while preserving the content. The formatter trims whitespace, ignores empty input, and handles null values. It uses regex to identify paragraph breaks and constructs the HTML output by appending `<p>` tags around each paragraph. The result is properly formatted HTML where each original paragraph is enclosed in its own `<p>` element.
