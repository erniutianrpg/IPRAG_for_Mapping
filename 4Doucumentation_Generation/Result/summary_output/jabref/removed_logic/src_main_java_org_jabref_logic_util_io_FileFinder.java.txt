The `FileFinder` interface defines a method `findAssociatedFiles` that searches specified directories for files associated with a given `BibEntry` (bibliography entry) and matching provided file extensions. It returns a list of file paths (`Path`) and may throw an `IOException` if an error occurs during file operations. This is typically used to locate relevant files (like PDFs) linked to bibliography entries.
