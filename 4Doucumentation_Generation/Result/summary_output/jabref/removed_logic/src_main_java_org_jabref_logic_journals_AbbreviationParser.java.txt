The `AbbreviationParser` class reads journal abbreviation lists from CSV files (either from resources or file paths) and stores them in a `LinkedHashSet` to maintain order and avoid duplicates. Each CSV entry should contain a full journal name, its abbreviation, and optionally the shortest unique abbreviation. The parsed abbreviations are accessible via `getAbbreviations()`. The class handles UTF-8 encoding by default and logs errors if file reading fails.
