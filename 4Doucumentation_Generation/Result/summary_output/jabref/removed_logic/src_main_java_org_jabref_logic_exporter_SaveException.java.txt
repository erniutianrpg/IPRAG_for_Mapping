The `SaveException` class is a custom exception for handling errors during file saving in JabRef. It tracks the problematic `BibEntry` (if applicable) and provides localized error messages. It includes common static exceptions like `FILE_LOCKED` and `BACKUP_CREATION`, and multiple constructors to handle different error scenarios (with/without entries, status codes, or localized messages). The class also provides methods to check if an entry caused the error (`specificEntry()`) and to retrieve the entry (`getEntry()`) or status (`getStatus()`).
