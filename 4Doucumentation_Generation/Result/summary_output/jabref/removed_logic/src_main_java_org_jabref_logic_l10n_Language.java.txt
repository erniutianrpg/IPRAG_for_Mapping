This code defines an enum `Language` that represents supported languages in JabRef, each with a display name and locale ID (typically ISO 639-1). It includes methods to get the display name and ID, and a utility method `convertToSupportedLocale` that converts a `Language` into a `Locale` object, handling language-country codes (e.g., "pt_BR") by splitting them into parts. If the locale format is invalid, it defaults to `Locale.ENGLISH`. The enum covers 25 languages, from Arabic to Vietnamese.
