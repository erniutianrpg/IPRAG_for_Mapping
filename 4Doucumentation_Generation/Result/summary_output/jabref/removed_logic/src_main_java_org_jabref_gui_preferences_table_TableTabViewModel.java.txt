This code implements a ViewModel for a table preferences tab in JabRef, managing settings for the main entry table's columns and name display. It handles column customization (adding/removing/moving columns), special fields, file columns, auto-resizing, and name formatting options (display style and abbreviation). The class stores and retrieves preferences, validates settings, and provides properties for UI binding. Key features include managing column lists, toggling special fields/file columns, and configuring how author names are displayed in the table.
