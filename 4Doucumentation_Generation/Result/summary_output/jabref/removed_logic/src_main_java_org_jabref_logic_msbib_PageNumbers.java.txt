The `PageNumbers` class parses and represents page number ranges in MSBib format. It takes a string input (like "10-15") and splits it into start and end integers using regex. If the input doesn't match the pattern (e.g., "ix-xii"), it stores it as freeform text. The class provides methods to: 1) generate an XML DOM element with either structured page numbers or freeform text, and 2) output the page range as a string with a configurable separator (defaulting to "-"). Useful for handling both numeric and non-numeric page ranges.
