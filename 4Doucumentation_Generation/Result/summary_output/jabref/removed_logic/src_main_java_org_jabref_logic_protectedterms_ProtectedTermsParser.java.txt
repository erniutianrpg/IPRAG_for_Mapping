The `ProtectedTermsParser` class reads and parses protected terms (abbreviations) from files or resources. It processes text files where terms are listed, with optional descriptions starting with `#`. The class handles file reading, extracts terms and descriptions, and creates a `ProtectedTermsList` object containing the parsed data, which can be enabled/disabled and marked as internal. It supports both resource files (from classpath) and external files, with error logging for file access issues.
