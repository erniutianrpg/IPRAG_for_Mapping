The `PdfContentImporter` class extracts metadata from the first page of a PDF to create a BibTeX entry. It supports Springer and IEEE formats, parsing information like title, authors, abstract, keywords, DOI, year, and publisher. The importer processes PDF text line-by-line, cleans and formats data (e.g., author names), and constructs a `BibEntry` object. It handles encrypted PDFs and uses PDFBox for text extraction. The resulting entry includes PDF file references and supports technical reports and conference papers.
