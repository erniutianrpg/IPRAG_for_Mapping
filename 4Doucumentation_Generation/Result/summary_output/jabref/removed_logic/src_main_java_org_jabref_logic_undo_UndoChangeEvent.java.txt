The `UndoChangeEvent` class represents an event triggered when an undo or redo action occurs. It stores boolean flags indicating whether undo/redo is possible (`canUndo`, `canRedo`) and descriptive strings for the actions (`undoDescription`, `redoDescription`). The class provides getter methods to access these properties, allowing other components to check undo/redo availability and retrieve action descriptions. This serves as a notification mechanism for undo/redo state changes in the application. (98 words)
