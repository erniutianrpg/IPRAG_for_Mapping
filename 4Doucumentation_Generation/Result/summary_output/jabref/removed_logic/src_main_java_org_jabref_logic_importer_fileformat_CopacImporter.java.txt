The `CopacImporter` class is a Java importer for the COPAC bibliographic format. It reads text files, identifies COPAC entries by the "TI-" prefix, and converts them into BibTeX entries (defaulting to Book type). It processes fields like title, author, year, publisher, etc., appending multiple values with separators. The importer checks if the format is recognized by scanning for the "TI-" pattern and returns parsed entries as a `ParserResult`. It supports standard and custom fields, handling line continuations and multi-line entries.
