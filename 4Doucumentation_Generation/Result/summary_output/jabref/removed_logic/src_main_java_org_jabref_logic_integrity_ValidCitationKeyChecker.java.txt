The `ValidCitationKeyChecker` class ensures that a citation key is valid. It checks if the key is empty or null, returning an error message if so. If the key is not empty, it cleans the key using `CitationKeyGenerator.cleanKey()` and compares it to the original. If they differ, the key is invalid, and an error message is returned. Otherwise, the key is valid, and no error is returned. This class helps maintain proper citation key formatting in JabRef. (98 words)
