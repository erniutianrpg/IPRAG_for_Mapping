The `DoiCleanup` class standardizes and moves DOI (Digital Object Identifier) information in BibTeX entries. It checks if the DOI field is empty or contains a URL-encoded DOI, decodes and formats it properly. If the DOI is found in other fields (note, url, or ee), it moves it to the DOI field and clears the original field. The changes are tracked and returned as a list of `FieldChange` objects. This ensures DOIs are consistently stored in the correct field and properly formatted.
