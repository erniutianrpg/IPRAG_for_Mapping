The `Word` class represents a word in a BibTeX title, handling case conversion while respecting protected characters (enclosed in braces). It provides methods to convert words to uppercase, lowercase, or title case (capitalizing first letters), with special handling for small words (articles, prepositions, conjunctions) and hyphens. The class maintains sets of small words, conjunctions, and hyphen characters for case conversion rules. Protected characters remain unchanged during conversions. It also includes utility methods to check word types (small/larger words) and endings (colon).
