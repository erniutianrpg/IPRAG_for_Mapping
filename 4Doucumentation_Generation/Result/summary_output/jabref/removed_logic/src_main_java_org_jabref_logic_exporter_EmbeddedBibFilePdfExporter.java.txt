The `EmbeddedBibFilePdfExporter` class exports BibTeX entries to a PDF file by embedding them as a text file named "main.bib". It converts BibTeX entries to a string, reads the target PDF, and embeds the BibTeX data as an attached file using Apache PDFBox. If the PDF doesn't exist or isn't writable, the operation is skipped. The exporter handles write protection and temporary file creation to ensure data integrity during the embedding process.
