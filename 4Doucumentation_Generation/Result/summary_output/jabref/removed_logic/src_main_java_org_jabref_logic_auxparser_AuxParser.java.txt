The `AuxParser` interface defines a method `parse` that takes a LaTeX AUX file path as input and returns an `AuxParserResult`. This result contains a generated BibDatabase (bibliography database) and parsing statistics, summarizing the parsing process of the AUX file. The interface serves as a contract for parsing LaTeX auxiliary files to extract bibliography-related data. (59 words)
