The `CitationStylePreviewLayout` class implements a preview layout for generating citations in JabRef. It uses a specified citation style (e.g., APA, MLA) to format BibTeX entries into HTML previews. The class delegates citation generation to `CitationStyleGenerator` and provides methods to access the style's metadata (name, source, file path). It acts as an adapter between JabRef's preview system and citation style functionality.
