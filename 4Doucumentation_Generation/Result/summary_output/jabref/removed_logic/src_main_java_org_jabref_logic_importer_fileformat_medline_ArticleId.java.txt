The `ArticleId` record in Java defines a simple immutable data structure with two fields: `idType` (a String representing the type of article ID) and `content` (a String containing the actual ID value). This record is likely used to store and pass article identifier information in a Medline-related context. The record's concise syntax automatically provides a constructor, getters, `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` methods.
