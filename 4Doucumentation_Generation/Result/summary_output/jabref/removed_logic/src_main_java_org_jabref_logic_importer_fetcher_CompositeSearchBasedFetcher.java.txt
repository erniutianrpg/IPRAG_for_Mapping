The `CompositeSearchBasedFetcher` class combines multiple `SearchBasedFetcher` instances to perform parallel searches across different sources. It takes a set of fetchers and a maximum result limit, removes self-references to prevent recursion, and executes concurrent searches. Results are collected, limited to the specified maximum, and returned as a unified list. Failed fetcher requests are logged but don't halt execution. This provides a single interface to query multiple bibliographic sources simultaneously.
