This code defines a `JournalAbbreviator` class that abbreviates journal names using a provided abbreviation repository. It implements `LayoutFormatter` to format input text (journal names) into their abbreviated forms. If no abbreviation is found (or if the input is already abbreviated), it returns the original text unchanged. For example, "Physical Review Letters" would be abbreviated to "Phys. Rev. Lett." if found in the repository. The abbreviation lookup is handled by `JournalAbbreviationRepository`.
