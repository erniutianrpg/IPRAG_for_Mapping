The `OpenLibraryIsbnFetcher` class fetches book metadata from OpenLibrary's API using an ISBN number. It converts the JSON response into a `BibEntry` object, extracting fields like title, authors, publisher, pages, and publication year. The fetcher handles author information by querying additional API endpoints if needed. It extends `AbstractIsbnFetcher` to validate ISBNs and construct API URLs. The class also includes error handling for invalid responses or missing data. The result is a formatted bibliography entry compatible with JabRef.
