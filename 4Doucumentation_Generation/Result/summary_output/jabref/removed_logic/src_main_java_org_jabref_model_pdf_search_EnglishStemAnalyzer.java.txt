The `EnglishStemAnalyzer` class extends Lucene's `Analyzer` to process text by: 1) tokenizing input using `StandardTokenizer`, 2) converting tokens to lowercase, 3) removing English stop words, 4) normalizing digits, and 5) applying Porter stemming to reduce words to their root forms. This prepares text for efficient indexing and searching.
