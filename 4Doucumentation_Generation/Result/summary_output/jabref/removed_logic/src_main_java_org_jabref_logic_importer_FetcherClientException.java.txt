The `FetcherClientException` class is a custom exception in Java that extends `FetcherException`. It is thrown when HTTP client errors (status codes 400-499) occur during data fetching. The class provides three constructors to create exceptions with different details: error message, error message with cause, and error message with localized message and cause. This helps handle client-side HTTP errors in a structured way. (Word count: 59)
