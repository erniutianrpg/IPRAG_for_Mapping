The `XmpUtilWriter` class writes BibTeX entries as XMP metadata into PDF files using Dublin Core schema. It handles both document information (author, title, etc.) and custom XMP metadata. Key features include:

1. Writing single or multiple BibEntries to a PDF's XMP data
2. Privacy filtering for sensitive fields
3. Conversion of BibTeX entries to Dublin Core format
4. Handling of encrypted PDFs and temporary files during writing
5. Support for database references and string resolution

The class uses Apache PDFBox for PDF manipulation and XMPBox for XMP metadata handling, ensuring existing metadata is preserved while BibTeX data is updated.
