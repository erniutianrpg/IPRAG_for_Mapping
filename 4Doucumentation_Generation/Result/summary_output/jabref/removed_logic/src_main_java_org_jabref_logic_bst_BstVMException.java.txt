The `BstVMException` class is a custom runtime exception in Java that extends `RuntimeException`. It's used to handle errors in the BST (BibTeX Style) virtual machine logic, typically for BibTeX-related processing. The class simply provides a constructor to create exceptions with a custom error message, which is passed to the parent `RuntimeException` class. This allows for specialized error handling in BST VM operations. (49 words)
