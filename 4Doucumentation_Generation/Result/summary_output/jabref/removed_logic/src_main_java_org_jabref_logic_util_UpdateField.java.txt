This code provides utility methods for updating fields in BibTeX entries (`BibEntry`). Key functionalities include:

1. Updating fields (with optional nullification if values match) and tracking changes via `FieldChange`.
2. Setting automatic fields like owner and timestamp based on preferences, with options to overwrite existing values.
3. Handling both single entries and collections of entries, with checks for displayable/non-displayable fields.

The class ensures proper field management while maintaining entry formatting and change tracking.
