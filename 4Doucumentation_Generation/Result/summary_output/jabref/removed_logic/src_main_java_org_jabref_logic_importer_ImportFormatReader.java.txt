The `ImportFormatReader` class manages various bibliography import formats in JabRef. It maintains a list of importers (like BibTeX, EndNote, RIS) and provides methods to:
1. Import from a specified format (`importFromFile`)
2. List available formats (`getImportFormatList`)
3. Auto-detect and import unknown formats (`importUnknownFormat`) by trying all available importers and selecting the most successful one
4. Fall back to BibTeX format if auto-detection fails

The class supports both file-based and string-based imports, handling various bibliography formats through different importer implementations.
