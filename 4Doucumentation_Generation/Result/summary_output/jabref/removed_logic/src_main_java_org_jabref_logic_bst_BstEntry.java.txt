The `BstEntry` class wraps a `BibEntry` (a bibliography entry) and provides additional storage for string and integer values via three maps: `localStrings`, `fields`, and `localIntegers`. It acts as a container to extend a bibliography entry with temporary data during BST (BibTeX Style) processing. The class is initialized with a `BibEntry` object.
