The `LayoutHelper` class parses a text layout definition (from a `Reader`) into structured components (fields, commands, groups, etc.) for creating a `Layout` object. It handles various layout elements like field markers (`begin`, `end`), groups (`begingroup`, `endgroup`), formatting options, filenames, and encoding names. The parsed components are stored as `StringInt` objects (string-value pairs) and processed into a `Layout` instance. The class uses a `PushbackReader` for parsing and supports trimming/lowercasing commands. It's primarily used in JabRef for formatting bibliographic data.
