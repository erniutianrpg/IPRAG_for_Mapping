The `SharedEntriesNotPresentEvent` class is an event that triggers when a user attempts to push changes of obsolete `BibEntry` items to a server. It holds a list of affected bibliography entries (`bibEntries`) and provides a constructor to initialize them, along with a getter method to retrieve the entries. This event serves as a notification mechanism for outdated entries during synchronization. (98 words)
