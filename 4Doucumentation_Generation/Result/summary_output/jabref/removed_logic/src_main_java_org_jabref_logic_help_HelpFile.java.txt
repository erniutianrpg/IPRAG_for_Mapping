The `HelpFile` enum defines all help pages for JabRef, mapping each page to its corresponding markdown file in the GitHub user documentation. Each enum constant represents a specific help topic (e.g., entry editor, groups, citation keys) with a `pageName` field storing the relative path to the documentation file. The class provides a method `getPageName()` to retrieve these paths. This centralizes help page references for easy maintenance and linking to the online documentation.
