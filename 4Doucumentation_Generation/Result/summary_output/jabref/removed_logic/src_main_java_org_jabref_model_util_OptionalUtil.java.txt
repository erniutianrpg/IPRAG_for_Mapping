The `OptionalUtil` class provides utility methods for working with Java `Optional` objects. Key functionalities include: converting `Optional` to `List` or `Stream`, checking equality between two `Optional` values with a custom comparator, combining two `Optional` values, performing flatMap operations, and conditional checks like `isPresentAnd`. It also offers helper methods for handling absent values with fallbacks (`orElse`). These utilities simplify `Optional` operations, especially before Java 9 which added similar native methods.
