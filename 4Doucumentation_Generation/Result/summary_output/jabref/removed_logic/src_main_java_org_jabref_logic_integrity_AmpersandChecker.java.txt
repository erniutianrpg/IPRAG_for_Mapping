The `AmpersandChecker` class checks BibTeX entries for unescaped ampersands (`&`) in field values. It uses a regex to find ampersands preceded by any number of backslashes (`\`), then counts those with an even number of backslashes (indicating unescaped ampersands). For each unescaped ampersand found, it adds an integrity warning message to the results. The checker ensures proper LaTeX escaping in BibTeX fields.
