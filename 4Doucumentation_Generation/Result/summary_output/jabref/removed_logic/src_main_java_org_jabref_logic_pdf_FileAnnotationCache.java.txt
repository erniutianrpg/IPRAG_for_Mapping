The `FileAnnotationCache` class implements a cache for storing PDF file annotations linked to BibTeX entries. It uses Google Guava's `LoadingCache` with a maximum size of 10 entries. The cache maps each `BibEntry` to a collection of file paths and their associated annotations. Annotations are imported via `EntryAnnotationImporter` when first requested. The class provides methods to retrieve annotations (which caches them) and remove entries from the cache. It's designed for JabRef to efficiently manage PDF annotations while avoiding excessive memory usage.
