The `RenamePdfCleanup` class renames PDF files linked to a BibTeX entry to match a suggested naming convention. It processes each linked file, skipping absolute paths if configured (`onlyRelativePaths`). For each valid file, it uses `LinkedFileHandler` to attempt renaming. If successful, it updates the entry's file list. Errors during renaming are logged. Returns a list of changes if any files were renamed, otherwise an empty list. This cleanup operates within a specified database context and file preferences.
