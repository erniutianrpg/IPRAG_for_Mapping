The `JabRefLocaleProvider` class implements a `LocaleProvider` that loads CSL (Citation Style Language) locale files from a specified directory (`/csl-locales`). It caches loaded locales in a map and retrieves them by language code. If a locale isn't cached, it reads the corresponding XML file from the resources, throwing exceptions if the file is missing or unreadable. This is a modified version of `DefaultLocaleProvider` from the citeproc library, tailored for JabRef's use case.
