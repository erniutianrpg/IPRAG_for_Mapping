The `LowerCaseFormatter` class converts all characters in a string to lowercase, except for words enclosed in curly braces `{}`. It extends a `Formatter` class, providing metadata like name, key, description, and example. The core functionality in the `format` method processes the input string using a `Title` class to handle words, converting each to lowercase unless they start with `{`. For example, "KDE {Amarok}" becomes "kde {Amarok}".
