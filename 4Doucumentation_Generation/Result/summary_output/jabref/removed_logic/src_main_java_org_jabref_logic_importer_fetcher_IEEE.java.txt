This code implements a fetcher for IEEE Xplore, a digital library for scientific papers. It provides two main functionalities:

1. **Fulltext PDF Retrieval**: It searches for PDF URLs of IEEE entries by checking either direct links or resolving DOIs to find downloadable PDFs on IEEE's website.

2. **Metadata Search**: It queries IEEE's API to fetch bibliographic metadata (title, authors, DOI, etc.) and converts the JSON response into BibTeX entries. The search supports filters like publication year, journal name, and article number.

The class implements interfaces for fulltext fetching and paginated search, handling API keys and custom queries while parsing IEEE-specific response formats.
