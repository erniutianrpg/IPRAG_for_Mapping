The `ShortDOIServiceException` class is a custom exception that extends `JabRefException`, specifically for handling errors related to short DOI services in JabRef. It provides multiple constructors to create exceptions with different combinations of error messages (both general and localized) and underlying causes, following standard exception-handling patterns. This allows for flexible error reporting in DOI-related operations. (98 words)
