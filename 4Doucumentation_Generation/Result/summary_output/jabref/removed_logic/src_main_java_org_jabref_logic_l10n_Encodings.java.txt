This Java class `Encodings` provides a list of available character encodings (charsets) on the system. It initializes two public static arrays: `ENCODINGS` (containing `Charset` objects) and `ENCODINGS_DISPLAYNAMES` (containing their display names). The class uses Java's `Charset.availableCharsets()` to fetch all available charsets, removes duplicates, and stores them in a list. A static block populates the arrays during class loading. The method `getCharsets()` returns the list of distinct charsets. The class is utility-focused (constructor is private).
