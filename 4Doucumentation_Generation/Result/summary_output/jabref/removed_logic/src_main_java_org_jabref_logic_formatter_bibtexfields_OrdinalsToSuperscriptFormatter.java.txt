This code converts ordinal numbers (like 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th) in a string to LaTeX superscript format (e.g., `1\textsuperscript{st}`). It uses regex to detect ordinal patterns and replaces them with the appropriate LaTeX syntax. The formatter handles all ordinals, even incorrect ones (e.g., 21rd), and preserves the original case. It's part of a BibTeX field formatting utility.
