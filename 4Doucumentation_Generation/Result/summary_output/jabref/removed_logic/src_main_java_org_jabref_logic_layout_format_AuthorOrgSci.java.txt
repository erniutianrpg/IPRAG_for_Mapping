This code formats author names in a bibliography according to the OrgSci standard: the first author is displayed as "Last, First" with abbreviated first names, while subsequent authors are shown as "First Last" with abbreviations. Spaces between abbreviated first names are preserved. If the input is empty, it returns the original text. The formatter handles an author list parsed from a string, processing each author accordingly.
