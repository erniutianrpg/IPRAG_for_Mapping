The `AtomicFileOutputStream` class provides atomic file writing by first writing to a temporary file, then replacing the target file upon successful completion. Key features include:

1. Writes to a temporary file (.tmp) initially
2. Creates a backup (.bak) of the original file if it exists
3. Atomically moves the temporary file to replace the target file
4. Handles errors by cleaning up temporary files and preserving backups if needed
5. Maintains file permissions and supports optional backup retention

This ensures data integrity by preventing partial writes and providing recovery options through backups.
