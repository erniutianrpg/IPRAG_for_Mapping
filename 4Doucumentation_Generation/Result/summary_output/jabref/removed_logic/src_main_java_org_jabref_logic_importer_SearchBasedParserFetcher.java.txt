The `SearchBasedParserFetcher` interface extends `SearchBasedFetcher` to provide a standardized three-step process for fetching bibliographic entries from non-BibTeX web resources: (1) crafting a URL from a search query, (2) parsing the response into `BibEntry` objects, and (3) optional post-processing cleanup. It includes methods to generate query URLs, parse responses using a `Parser`, and clean up entries. Default implementations handle network requests and basic error handling, while allowing customization via method overrides. This interface supports multi-inheritance for fetchers with mixed query types.
