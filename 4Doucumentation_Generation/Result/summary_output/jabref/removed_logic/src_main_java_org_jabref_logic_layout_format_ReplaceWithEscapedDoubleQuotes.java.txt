This code defines a `LayoutFormatter` that processes a string by replacing every double quote (`"`) with two double quotes (`""`). This is commonly used for escaping double quotes in text fields, such as when preparing strings for CSV files where double quotes need to be doubled to be treated as literal characters. The formatter iterates through each character of the input string and constructs a new string with the replacements.
