The `BracesCorrector` class balances curly braces in a string by adding missing opening `{` or closing `}` braces. It first removes escaped braces (`\{` or `\}`), then calculates the difference between unescaped opening and closing braces. If braces are unbalanced, it prepends `{` or appends `}` until balanced, returning the corrected string. Null input returns null.
