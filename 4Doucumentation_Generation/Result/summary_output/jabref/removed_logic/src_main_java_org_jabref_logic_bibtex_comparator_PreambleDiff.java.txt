The `PreambleDiff` class compares the preamble (introductory content) of two BibTeX databases. It provides a static method `compare` that checks if the preambles of two databases differ, returning an `Optional<PreambleDiff` containing the original and new preambles if they differ, or `Optional.empty()` if they're identical. The class includes getters for both preambles and overrides `equals()` and `hashCode()` for proper comparison and hashing of `PreambleDiff` instances.
