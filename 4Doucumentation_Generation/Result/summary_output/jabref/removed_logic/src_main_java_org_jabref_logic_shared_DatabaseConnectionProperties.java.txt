This Java interface `DatabaseConnectionProperties` defines methods to retrieve database connection properties, including database type (DBMSType), name, port, host, user credentials, password, SSL settings, timezone, and keystore path. It also provides a method `isValid()` to check if the connection properties are valid. The interface serves as a contract for classes that need to access or manage database connection details.
