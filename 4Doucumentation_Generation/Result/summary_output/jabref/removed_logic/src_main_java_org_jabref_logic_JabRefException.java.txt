This code defines a custom exception class `JabRefException` that extends `Exception`. It provides multiple constructors to handle different scenarios: with a message, a cause, or both, and optionally a localized message. The `getLocalizedMessage()` method returns the localized message if available; otherwise, it falls back to the standard message. This class is primarily used for error handling in JabRef, supporting both regular and localized error messages for better user experience. (98 words)
