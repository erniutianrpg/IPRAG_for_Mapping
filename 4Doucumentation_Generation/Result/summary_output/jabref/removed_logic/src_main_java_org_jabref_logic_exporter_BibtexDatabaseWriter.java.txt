The `BibtexDatabaseWriter` class writes BibTeX/BibLaTeX database files (.bib format). It handles writing various components including entries, strings, metadata, comments, preamble, and prolog (encoding info). It formats content using `BibWriter` and respects save configurations, field preferences, and citation key patterns. The class ensures proper structure and formatting while preserving unchanged content when reformatting is disabled. It supports custom entry types and handles encoding specifications, particularly when non-UTF-8 or explicitly set.
