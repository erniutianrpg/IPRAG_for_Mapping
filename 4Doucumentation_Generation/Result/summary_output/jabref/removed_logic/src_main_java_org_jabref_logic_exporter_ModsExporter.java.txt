The `ModsExporter` class exports BibTeX entries to MODS (Metadata Object Description Schema) XML format. It maps BibEntry fields (like author, title, journal) to corresponding MODS XML elements, handles various metadata types (identifiers, dates, locations), and organizes them into a structured XML document using JAXB marshalling. The exporter supports multiple values for fields like authors and keywords, and formats the output as a well-formed XML file compliant with the MODS schema.
