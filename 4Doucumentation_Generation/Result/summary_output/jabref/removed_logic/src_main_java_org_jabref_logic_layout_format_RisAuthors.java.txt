This code formats a list of authors for RIS (Research Information Systems) output. It takes a string of author names, splits them into individual authors, and formats each with a prefix (configurable via `setArgument`) and "  - " before each name. Authors are separated by newlines. For example, "John Doe and Jane Smith" becomes "  - Doe, John[newline]  - Smith, Jane". The `fixAuthorLastNameFirst` method ensures last names appear first. Empty input returns an empty string.
