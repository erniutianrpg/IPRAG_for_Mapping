The `DOICheck` class formats DOI (Digital Object Identifier) strings for proper URL representation. If the input is null, it returns null. It removes a leading slash if present, then attempts to parse the string as a DOI. If successful, it converts the DOI to its ASCII URI format (e.g., "http://doi.org/10.xxx"); otherwise, it returns the original string. This ensures DOIs are properly formatted as clickable URLs in HTML exports.
