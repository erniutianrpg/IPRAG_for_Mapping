The `DoiFetcher` class is a JabRef plugin that fetches bibliographic entries using DOI (Digital Object Identifier) identifiers. It supports both DOI-based and entry-based searches, handles API rate limiting for different DOI agencies (Crossref, DataCite, mEDRA), and performs content negotiation to retrieve BibTeX data. The fetcher also includes post-processing cleanup for fields like pages and URLs, and special handling for APS journal entries. It implements rate limiting to comply with API restrictions and updates Crossref's dynamic rate limits.
