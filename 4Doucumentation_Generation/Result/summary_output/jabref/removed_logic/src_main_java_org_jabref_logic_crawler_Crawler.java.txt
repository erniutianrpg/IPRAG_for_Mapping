The `Crawler` class automates the process of searching and storing studies for Systematic Literature Reviews (SLR). It uses a `StudyRepository` to manage the repository and a `StudyFetcher` to crawl specified e-libraries based on queries from a study definition file. The `performCrawl()` method executes the search, persists results in a BibTeX file (`studyResult.bib`), and handles Git branch operations for version control. Dependencies include Git handling, preferences, and file monitoring.
