The `Iso690FormatDate` class formats date strings into ISO 690 standard format (YYYY-MM-DD). It splits the input string by "de" to separate day, month, and year components. If only one component exists, it treats it as a year. For two components (month, year), it formats as "YYYY-MM". For three components (day, month, year), it formats as "YYYY-MM-DD". Blank inputs return an empty string. This is useful for standardizing date formats in bibliographic references.
