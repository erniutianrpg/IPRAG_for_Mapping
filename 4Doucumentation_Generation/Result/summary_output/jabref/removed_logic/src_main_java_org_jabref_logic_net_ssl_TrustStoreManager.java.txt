The `TrustStoreManager` class manages a Java KeyStore for SSL certificates. It creates a truststore file if it doesn't exist, loads it, and provides methods to add, delete, check existence, and list certificates. It specifically handles custom certificates (marked with `[custom]` suffix), allowing their bulk deletion and retrieval. The class also includes a method to flush changes back to the file. It uses a default password "changeit" and logs errors during operations. The truststore is initialized from a default JDK truststore if missing.
