The `FileFieldParser` class parses a string representation of file links into a list of `LinkedFile` objects. It handles complex cases including escaped characters, XML special characters, and Windows paths. The input string follows the format "description:path:type" with elements separated by semicolons. The parser processes each character sequentially, tracking escape sequences and XML characters, then converts valid paths/URLs into `LinkedFile` objects. It gracefully handles malformed URLs or paths by falling back to string representations when necessary.
