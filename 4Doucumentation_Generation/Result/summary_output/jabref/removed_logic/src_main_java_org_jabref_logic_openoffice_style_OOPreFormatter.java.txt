The `OOPreFormatter` class preprocesses JabRef bibliography fields by converting LaTeX formatting commands into HTML tags. It handles special characters, replaces LaTeX commands (like `\textit`, `\textbf`) with corresponding HTML tags (like `<i>`, `<b>`), and processes Unicode conversions. The formatter also manages escape sequences, math mode simplifications (converting `$...$` to `{...}`), and special character replacements (like `\&` to `&`). The output is a string with HTML-compatible formatting ready for further processing in bibliography styles.
