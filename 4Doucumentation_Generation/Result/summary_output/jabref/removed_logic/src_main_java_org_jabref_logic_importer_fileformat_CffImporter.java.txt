The `CffImporter` class is a JabRef plugin that imports bibliographic data from Citation File Format (CFF) YAML files, primarily used for citing software. It maps CFF fields to JabRef fields, handles author formatting, processes identifiers (DOIs and SWHIDs), and creates BibTeX entries. The importer recognizes valid CFF files by checking for a title field and supports both software and dataset entry types. Unmapped fields are preserved as unknown fields.
