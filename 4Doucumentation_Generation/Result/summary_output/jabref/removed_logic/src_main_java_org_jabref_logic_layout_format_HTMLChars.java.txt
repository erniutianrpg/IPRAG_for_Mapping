The `HTMLChars` class formats text for HTML output by converting LaTeX commands and special characters to their HTML equivalents. It handles line breaks, escapes special characters (like `&` to `&amp;`), converts LaTeX commands (e.g., `\textbf` to `<b>`), and replaces LaTeX symbols (e.g., `\~{n}` to `Ã±`). It also processes nested commands, math mode simplifications (`$...$` to `{...}`), and preserves formatting like italics, bold, and underlines. Remaining `~` are converted to non-breaking spaces (`&nbsp;`).
