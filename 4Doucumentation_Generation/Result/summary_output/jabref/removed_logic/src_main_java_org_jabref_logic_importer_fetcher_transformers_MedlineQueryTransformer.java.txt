The `MedlineQueryTransformer` class extends `AbstractQueryTransformer` to format search queries specifically for Medline/Pubmed databases. It appends field-specific suffixes (e.g., `[au]` for authors, `[ti]` for titles) to search terms and handles logical operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`). It also processes year ranges for publication dates, converting them into the format `startYear:endYear[dp]`. This transformer ensures queries comply with Pubmed's search syntax requirements.
