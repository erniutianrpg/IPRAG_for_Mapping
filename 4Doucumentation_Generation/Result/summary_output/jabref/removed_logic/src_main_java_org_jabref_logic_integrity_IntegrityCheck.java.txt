The `IntegrityCheck` class performs data validation on a BibTeX/BibLaTeX database. It checks individual entries for issues like invalid citation keys, type mismatches, HTML/ASCII characters, ampersands, journal abbreviations, and field validity. It also verifies database-level integrity, such as DOI duplication. The checks vary based on whether the database is in BibTeX or BibLaTeX mode. Results are returned as a list of `IntegrityMessage` objects indicating any detected problems. The class combines both field-specific and entry-wide validations.
