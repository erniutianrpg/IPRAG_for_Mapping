The `DBMSConnectionPropertiesBuilder` class is a builder pattern implementation for creating `DBMSConnectionProperties` objects. It allows setting various database connection parameters (type, host, port, database, user, password, SSL, etc.) through chainable methods. If no port is specified, it uses the default port for the given database type. The `createDBMSConnectionProperties()` method finalizes and returns the configured connection properties object. This provides a flexible way to construct database connection configurations. (98 words)
