This code converts numbers in a string to their ordinal form (e.g., 1 → "1st", 2 → "2nd"). It uses regex to find numbers, then appends the appropriate suffix ("st", "nd", "rd", or "th") based on the last digit (with special handling for 11-13). For example, "1" becomes "1st", "3" becomes "3rd", and "11" becomes "11th". The formatted string is returned with all numbers converted.
