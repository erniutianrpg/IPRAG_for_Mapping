The `BstPurifier` class cleans a string by:  
1. Converting whitespace, hyphens, and tildes to spaces  
2. Keeping only alphanumeric characters  
3. Handling special LaTeX control sequences (within braces) by preserving their alphabetic content  
4. Logging warnings for unbalanced braces  
5. Returning the purified string  

It's designed to process BibTeX strings by removing non-alphanumeric characters while preserving meaningful content from LaTeX commands. (98 words)
