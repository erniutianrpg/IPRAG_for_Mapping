The `INSPIREBibtexFilterReader` is a specialized `FilterReader` that processes BibTeX entries from INSPIRE database output. It extracts content between `<pre>` HTML tags and modifies BibTeX article entries by replacing spaces with underscores in the citation keys (e.g., `@Article{example key,` becomes `@Article{example_key,`). The reader processes input line by line, ensuring only relevant content between `<pre>` tags is considered. It implements only the `read()` method, returning characters one at a time or a newline when a line ends.
