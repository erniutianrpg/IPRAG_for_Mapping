The code defines a `CleanupJob` functional interface with a single method `cleanup` that takes a `BibEntry` (a bibliography entry) and returns a list of `FieldChange` objects. This interface is designed to perform cleanup operations on bibliography entries, where each operation may modify fields and track changes. The functional interface allows for lambda implementations.
