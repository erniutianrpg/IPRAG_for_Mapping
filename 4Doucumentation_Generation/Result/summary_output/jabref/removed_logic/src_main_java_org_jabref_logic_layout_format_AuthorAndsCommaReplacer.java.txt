This code formats author lists in bibliographic entries. For a single author, it returns the name unchanged. For two authors, it joins them with " & ". For three or more authors, it formats them as "Author1, Author2, ..., AuthorN-1 & AuthorN". Essentially, it replaces " and " separators with commas and ampersands based on the number of authors.
