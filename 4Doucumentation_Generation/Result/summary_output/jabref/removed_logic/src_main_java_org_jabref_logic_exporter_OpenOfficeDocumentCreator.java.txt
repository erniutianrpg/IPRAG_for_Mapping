This code exports BibTeX entries to an OpenOffice/LibreOffice Calc (SXC) file format. It creates a ZIP file containing XML content (converted from BibTeX entries) along with required OpenOffice resource files (meta.xml, mimetype, manifest.xml). The process involves: 1) converting entries to XML, 2) storing them in a temporary file, 3) packaging everything into a ZIP with proper structure, and 4) cleaning up the temporary file. The exporter only runs if there are entries to export.
