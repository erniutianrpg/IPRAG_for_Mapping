The `AbstractQueryTransformer` class is an abstract base for transforming Lucene query nodes into library-specific query strings. It handles various query node types (Boolean, Field, Group, Modifier) and provides methods to process different field types (author, title, journal, year, etc.). Key functionalities include converting logical operators (AND, OR, NOT), parsing year ranges, and formatting fielded terms. Concrete implementations must define specific handling for fields and operators. The transformer also cleans up the final query by removing unnecessary outer braces.
