The `CitationStyleCache` class caches citation strings for `BibEntry` objects to improve performance, as generating citations via JavaScript can be slow. It uses a Guava `LoadingCache` with a maximum size of 1024 entries. The cache invalidates entries when they are modified or removed (handled via event listeners) or when the citation style changes. The main functionality includes getting a citation for an entry (`getCitationFor`) and updating the citation style (`setCitationStyle`). This ensures efficient and up-to-date citation generation in a bibliography database context.
