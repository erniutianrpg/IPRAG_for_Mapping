This code handles remote command-line arguments for JabRef, a reference management software. It processes the arguments using an `ArgumentProcessor` in remote mode, then loads the results. Each parsed result is added to JabRef's main GUI frame on the JavaFX thread, with the first result focused. Errors during parsing are logged. The class implements `RemoteMessageHandler` and relies on `PreferencesService` for configuration.
