The `ShortDOIService` class provides functionality to obtain shortened DOI names using the shortdoi.org service. It takes a DOI as input, constructs a URL request to the shortdoi.org API with JSON format, and retrieves the shortened DOI from the JSON response. The main method `getShortDOI` returns the shortened DOI, while `makeRequest` handles the HTTP request and JSON parsing, throwing exceptions for any errors encountered during the process.
