The `RfcFetcher` class fetches RFC (Request for Comments) or IETF draft documents from the IETF datatracker website. It constructs a URL based on the given identifier (adding "rfc" prefix if needed) to retrieve the document in BibTeX format. The class implements `IdBasedParserFetcher`, providing methods to get the resource URL, parse the BibTeX response, and return help information. It handles both RFCs (e.g., "rfc1234") and drafts (e.g., "draft-name").
