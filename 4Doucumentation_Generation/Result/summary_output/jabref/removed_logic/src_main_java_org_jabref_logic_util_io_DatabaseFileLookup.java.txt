The `DatabaseFileLookup` class helps search for files associated with entries in a BibTeX database. It initializes by caching file paths from the database entries' "file" fields, excluding online links. The `lookupDatabase` method checks if a given file path exists in the cache. It also provides access to the database's directory path. The class improves efficiency by pre-loading file paths and avoiding repeated searches.
