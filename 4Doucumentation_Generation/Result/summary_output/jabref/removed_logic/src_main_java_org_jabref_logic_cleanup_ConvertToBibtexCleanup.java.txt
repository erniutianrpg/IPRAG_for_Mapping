This code converts a BibEntry from Biblatex to BibTeX format. It handles two main tasks: 1) Extracts year and month from the publication date if those fields are empty, then clears the date field if changes were made; 2) Converts field names from Biblatex to BibTeX using predefined aliases, copying values to the new fields only if the target fields are empty. The changes are tracked and returned as a list of FieldChange objects.
