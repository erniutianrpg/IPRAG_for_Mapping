This code formats a list of editor names into a DocBook 5 XML structure. It takes a string of editor names, parses them into an `AuthorList`, then uses a `DocBookAuthorFormatter` to convert each name into XML elements (`<editor><personname>...`) following DocBook 5 specifications. The output is a string containing the formatted XML tags for all editors.
