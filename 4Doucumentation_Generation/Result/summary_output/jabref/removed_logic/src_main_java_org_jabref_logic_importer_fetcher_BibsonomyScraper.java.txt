This code provides a utility class `BibsonomyScraper` to fetch BibTeX entries from the BibSonomy web service. Given a URL, it constructs a request to BibSonomy's scraper service, downloads the BibTeX data, and parses it into a `BibEntry` object. It handles URL encoding, network errors, and parsing exceptions, returning an `Optional<BibEntry>` that's empty if any step fails. The class is designed for integration with JabRef, a reference management software.
