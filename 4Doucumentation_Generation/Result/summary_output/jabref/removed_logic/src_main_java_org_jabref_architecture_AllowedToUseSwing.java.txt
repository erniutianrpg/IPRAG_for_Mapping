This code defines a custom annotation `@AllowedToUseSwing` in Java, specifically for marking logic classes that are permitted to access Swing components. The annotation includes a mandatory `value()` field to provide a rationale explaining why Swing access is allowed for the annotated class. This is likely used for architectural enforcement in the JabRef project to control Swing usage.
