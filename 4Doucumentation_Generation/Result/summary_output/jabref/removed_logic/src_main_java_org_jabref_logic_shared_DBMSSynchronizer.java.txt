The `DBMSSynchronizer` class handles bidirectional synchronization between a local BibTeX database and a shared SQL database. It listens to local database events (additions, updates, deletions) and propagates these changes to the shared database, while also pulling remote changes to keep the local database updated. Key features include conflict handling, metadata synchronization, and connection management. The class uses an event bus to notify about synchronization events and connection issues. It ensures data consistency by comparing entry versions and applying save actions.
