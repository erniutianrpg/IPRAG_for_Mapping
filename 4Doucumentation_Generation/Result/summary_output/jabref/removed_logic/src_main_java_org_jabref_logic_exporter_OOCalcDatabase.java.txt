This code exports a BibTeX database to an OpenOffice Calc (OOCalc) spreadsheet format. It takes BibTeX entries, sorts them by author, year, and citation key, then generates an XML document structure following OpenOffice's specifications. Each entry becomes a row with cells for type and standard fields (title, author, etc.), with special formatting for titles (removing brackets and whitespace). The output is a structured XML document ready for OpenOffice Calc.
