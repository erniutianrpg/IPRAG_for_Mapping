This code implements a fetcher for the Library of Congress Control Number (LCCN) that retrieves bibliographic data in MODS format. It constructs a URL using the LCCN identifier (e.g., `https://lccn.loc.gov/[identifier]/mods`) and uses the `ModsImporter` parser to process the fetched data. The class adheres to the `IdBasedParserFetcher` interface, providing methods for name, URL generation, and parsing. It requires `ImportFormatPreferences` for configuration. Essentially, it enables fetching and parsing Library of Congress records by their LCCN identifiers. (98 words)
