The `DefaultAuxParser` class parses LaTeX AUX files to extract BibTeX citations and nested AUX files. It processes citation keys (`\citation` or `\abx@aux@cite`) and nested AUX references (`\@input`), then matches them against a master BibTeX database. The parser resolves cross-references, clones relevant entries, and constructs a new BibDatabase containing only cited entries. It handles file I/O, logs warnings for missing files, and preserves database structure (preamble, strings). The result includes resolved entries and unresolved citation keys.
