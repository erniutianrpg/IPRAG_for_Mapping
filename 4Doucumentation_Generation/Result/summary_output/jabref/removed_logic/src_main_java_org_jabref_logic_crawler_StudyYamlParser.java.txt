The `StudyYamlParser` class provides functionality to read and write YAML files for `Study` objects. It uses Jackson's YAML processing to:
1. Parse a YAML file into a `Study` object (`parseStudyYamlFile`)
2. Serialize a `Study` object into a YAML file (`writeStudyYamlFile`), with specific YAML formatting preferences like minimized quotes and disabled document markers. The class handles file I/O operations and YAML conversion seamlessly.
