The `GroupDiff` class compares two sets of group tree nodes from JabRef's metadata to detect changes between them. The static `compare` method checks if the group structures in two `MetaData` objects differ, returning an `Optional<GroupDiff>` containing the original and new group roots if they differ, or `Optional.empty()` if they're identical. The class provides getters to access both group roots but doesn't identify specific change types, only whether a change occurred.
