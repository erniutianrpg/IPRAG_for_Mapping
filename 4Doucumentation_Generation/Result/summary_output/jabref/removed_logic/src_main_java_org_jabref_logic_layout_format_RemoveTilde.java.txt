The `RemoveTilde` class implements a `LayoutFormatter` that processes a string by replacing standalone tildes (`~`) with spaces. It preserves LaTeX commands by skipping the character following a backslash (`\`), ensuring commands remain intact. This is useful for formatting LaTeX code where tildes are often used as non-breaking spaces but need to be converted to regular spaces in certain contexts. The formatter iterates through each character, appending it to the result while handling escapes and tilde replacements.
