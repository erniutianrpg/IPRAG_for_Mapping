The `SentenceCaseFormatter` converts text to sentence case: it capitalizes the first letter of the first word and lowercases the rest, except for words starting with "{". For example, "i have {Aa} DREAM" becomes "I have {Aa} dream". It extends `Formatter`, providing metadata like name, key, description, and example. The formatting logic processes each sentence, applies lowercase, then capitalizes the first word while preserving protected words (enclosed in curly braces).
