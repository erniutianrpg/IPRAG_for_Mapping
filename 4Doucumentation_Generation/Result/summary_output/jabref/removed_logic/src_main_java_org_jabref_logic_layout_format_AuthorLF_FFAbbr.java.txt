This code defines a formatter (`AuthorLF_FFAbbr`) for author names in bibliographic entries. It takes a string of authors (`fieldText`), parses it into an `AuthorList`, and formats the names in "Last-First, First-First Last" order with abbreviations (e.g., "Doe, J. and Smith, A."). The `true` parameter indicates abbreviations should be used. The formatted string is returned.
