The `FileFinders` class provides a static method `constructFromConfiguration` that creates a `FileFinder` instance based on `AutoLinkPreferences`. Depending on the citation key dependency setting (START, EXACT, or REGEX), it returns either a `CitationKeyBasedFileFinder` (with exact match or not) or a `RegExpBasedFileFinder` configured with a regex pattern and separator. This factory method centralizes file finder creation based on user preferences. (94 words)
