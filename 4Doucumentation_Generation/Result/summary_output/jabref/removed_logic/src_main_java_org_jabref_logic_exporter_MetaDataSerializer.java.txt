The `MetaDataSerializer` class serializes metadata from a JabRef bibliography database into key-value string pairs. It handles various metadata types including save configurations, citation key patterns, file directories, content selectors, groups, and custom entry types. The main method `getSerializedStringMap` processes metadata into a serialized map, while helper methods handle specific cases like citation patterns, groups, and custom entry types. The output is formatted for storage, with proper escaping and separators.
