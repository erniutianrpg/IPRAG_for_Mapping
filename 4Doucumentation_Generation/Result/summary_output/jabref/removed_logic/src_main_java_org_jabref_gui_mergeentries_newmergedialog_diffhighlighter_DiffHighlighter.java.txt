This code defines an abstract `DiffHighlighter` class for highlighting differences between text in two `StyleClassedTextArea` components. It supports different diff methods (words, chars, commas) to split and compare text. The class provides methods to highlight differences, split/join strings using a separator, and manage diff methods. Implementations (like `SplitDiffHighlighter` and `UnifiedDiffHighlighter`) handle specific highlighting logic. It includes enums for diff methods (`BasicDiffMethod`) and change types (`ChangeType`), and a record (`Change`) to track modifications.
