This code separates combined citations into individual ones in an OpenOffice document. It:

1. Processes citation groups from a document
2. For each group with multiple citations:
   - Removes the combined citation
   - Creates separate citations for each entry
   - Inserts spaces between them (except after the last one)
3. Maintains document integrity during the process
4. Returns true if any modifications were made

The code handles OpenOffice document operations and citation formatting according to a specified style.
