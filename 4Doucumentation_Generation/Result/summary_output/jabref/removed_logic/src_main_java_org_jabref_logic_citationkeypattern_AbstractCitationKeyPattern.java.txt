This abstract class `AbstractCitationKeyPattern` manages citation key patterns for different entry types in a BibTeX database. It stores patterns in a map (`data`) with `EntryType` as keys and pattern strings (split into components) as values. Key functionalities include: splitting pattern strings into components, adding/retrieving patterns by entry type, checking if a pattern is default, and managing default patterns. The class also provides basic `toString`, `equals`, and `hashCode` methods. Subclasses must implement `getLastLevelCitationKeyPattern` to handle pattern retrieval when no match is found.
