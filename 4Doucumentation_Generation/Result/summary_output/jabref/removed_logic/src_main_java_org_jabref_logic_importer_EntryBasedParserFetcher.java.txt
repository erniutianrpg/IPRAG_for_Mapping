The `EntryBasedParserFetcher` interface defines a three-step process for fetching bibliographic entries: 1) Constructing a URL from a `BibEntry`, 2) Parsing the response into `BibEntry` objects using a `Parser`, and 3) Optional post-fetch cleanup of entries. It extends `EntryBasedFetcher` and implements `performSearch` to handle network requests, parsing, and cleanup. Default methods provide basic functionality, while key methods like `getURLForEntry` and `getParser` must be implemented by concrete classes. Errors during fetching or parsing are wrapped in `FetcherException`.
