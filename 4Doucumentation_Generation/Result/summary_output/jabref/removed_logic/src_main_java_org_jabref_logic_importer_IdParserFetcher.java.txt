The `IdParserFetcher` interface provides a standardized three-step process for fetching identifiers (like DOIs) for bibliographic entries: 1) Constructing a URL from a `BibEntry`, 2) Parsing the response into a list of `BibEntry` objects, and 3) Extracting the identifier from the results. It includes optional cleanup of fetched entries and handles errors like malformed URLs or I/O issues. The default implementation combines these steps in `findIdentifier()`, returning an `Optional` identifier or empty if not found.
