The `ProtectTermsFormatter` class protects specific terms (like acronyms, month names, and countries) in a text by wrapping them in curly braces `{}` to preserve their case. It uses a list of protected terms from `ProtectedTermsLoader` and applies the formatting only when the terms meet certain conditions (like being preceded by spaces or specific characters). This helps maintain consistent capitalization in BibTeX entries. The formatter includes methods for description, example input, and identification.
