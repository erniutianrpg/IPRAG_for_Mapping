The `ACMPortalFetcher` class implements a search-based fetcher for the ACM Portal digital library. It constructs a query URL for searching ACM's database using a `QueryNode`, transforms the query using `DefaultQueryTransformer`, and handles cookies for the website. The fetcher uses `ACMPortalParser` to process the search results. Key functionalities include URL construction with query parameters and providing help page information for the fetcher.
