The `EditionChecker` class validates the 'edition' field in bibliographic entries. For BibLaTeX mode, it ensures the value is an integer or literal string. For BibTeX mode, it checks if the first letter is capitalized (unless it's a digit) and optionally allows integers. It flags issues like using just "1" as an edition or invalid formats, returning localized error messages. The validation rules differ based on the bibliography mode (BibTeX/BibLaTeX) and configuration.
