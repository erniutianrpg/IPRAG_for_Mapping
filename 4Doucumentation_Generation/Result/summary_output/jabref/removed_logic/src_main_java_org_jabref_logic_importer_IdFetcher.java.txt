The `IdFetcher` interface defines a fetcher for retrieving article identifiers (like DOIs or ISBNs) from bibliographic data. It extends `WebFetcher` and provides two methods: `findIdentifier`, which searches for an identifier based on a given `BibEntry`, returning an `Optional` result, and `getIdentifierName`, which returns the type of identifier the fetcher handles. Implementations are expected to work with specific `Identifier` subtypes.
