The `RemoveBracesFormatter` class removes outer braces (`{}`) from a string if they enclose the entire content, while ensuring balanced braces internally. It checks for negative brace counts (more closing than opening braces) to avoid improper removal. For example, `"{In CDMA}"` becomes `"In CDMA"`, but `"{A} test {B}"` remains unchanged. This formatter is part of a BibTeX field cleanup utility.
