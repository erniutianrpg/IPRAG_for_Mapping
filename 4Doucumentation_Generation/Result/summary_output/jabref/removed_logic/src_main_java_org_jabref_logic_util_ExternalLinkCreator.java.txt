This code creates a search URL for ShortScience.org using a BibEntry's title. It takes a BibEntry as input, extracts the title field, and constructs a URL that points to ShortScience's search results for that title. If successful, it returns the URL as an Optional<String>; otherwise, it returns an empty Optional. The URL is built using URIBuilder to ensure proper formatting and includes the title as a search parameter.
