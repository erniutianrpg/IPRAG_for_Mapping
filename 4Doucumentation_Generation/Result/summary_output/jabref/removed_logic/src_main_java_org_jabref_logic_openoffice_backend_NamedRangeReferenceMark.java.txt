This code implements a `NamedRangeReferenceMark` class for managing named ranges (reference marks) in OpenOffice/LibreOffice documents. Key functionalities include:

1. Creating and removing reference marks in documents with optional invisible brackets
2. Safely inserting spaces between reference marks without affecting adjacent marks
3. Providing cursor operations to manipulate text ranges around reference marks
4. Handling edge cases for empty or single-character ranges
5. Maintaining compatibility with document operations while managing bracket visibility

The class serves as a backend for managing document references, particularly for citation handling in JabRef's OpenOffice integration.
