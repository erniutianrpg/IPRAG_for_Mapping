The `ManageCitations` class provides two static methods for handling citations in an OpenOffice document:  
1. `getCitationEntries` retrieves a list of citations from a given document.  
2. `applyCitationEntries` updates the document with a provided list of citations.  
Both methods use an `OOFrontend` instance to interact with the document and handle potential exceptions like missing documents or property errors. The class is utility-based (non-instantiable).
