The `FetcherResult` class is a simple immutable data container that holds two pieces of information: a `TrustLevel` (indicating the reliability of fetched data) and a `URL` (the source of the data). It provides getter methods to access these values but no setters, ensuring immutability. This class is likely used to return results from data fetchers in the JabRef reference management system.
