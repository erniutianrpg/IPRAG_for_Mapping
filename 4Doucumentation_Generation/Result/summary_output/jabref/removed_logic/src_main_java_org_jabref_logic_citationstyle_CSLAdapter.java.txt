The `CSLAdapter` class provides a thread-safe wrapper around the CSL (Citation Style Language) engine for generating bibliographies from BibTeX entries. It efficiently manages CSL instances, only recreating them when the citation style changes, and reuses them for subsequent calls with the same style. The main method `makeBibliography` synchronously processes entries, registers them with CSL, and returns formatted bibliography entries in the specified output format (e.g., HTML or RTF). This optimization reduces resource usage by avoiding redundant CSL instance creation.
