The `ExporterFactory` class manages export functionality in JabRef, creating and providing access to various exporters for different formats (HTML, XML, RTF, etc.). It initializes built-in exporters and custom formats, then offers methods to retrieve all exporters or find one by name. The factory is configured with preferences like layout, save settings, and database mode.
