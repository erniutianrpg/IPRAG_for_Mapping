The `ConnectionLostEvent` class is an event that is triggered when the connection to a shared database is lost. It holds a reference to the affected `BibDatabaseContext` (a database context in JabRef) and provides a getter method to access it. This event class is used to notify other components about the connection loss. (50 words)
