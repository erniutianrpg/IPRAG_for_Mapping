The `BooktitleChecker` class checks if a book title value ends with the phrase "conference on" (case-insensitive). If the input is blank, it returns no error. If the phrase is found at the end, it returns a warning message suggesting the booktitle should not end with "conference on". Otherwise, it returns no error. This is likely used to validate bibliographic data entries. (Word count: 58)
