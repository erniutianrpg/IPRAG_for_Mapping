The `JstorFetcher` class is a Java implementation for fetching bibliographic entries and full-text documents from JSTOR (a digital library). It provides three main functionalities:

1. **Search-Based Fetching**: Constructs URLs for search queries using Lucene query syntax and JSTOR's API.
2. **ID-Based Fetching**: Retrieves entries using identifiers (e.g., DOIs or stable URLs) by constructing appropriate JSTOR citation URLs.
3. **Full-Text Fetching**: Attempts to find and download full-text PDFs for given `BibEntry` objects by parsing JSTOR HTML pages.

The fetcher supports BibTeX parsing and handles both direct BibTeX responses and HTML-to-BibTeX conversions. It is part of the JabRef reference management software. (99 words)
