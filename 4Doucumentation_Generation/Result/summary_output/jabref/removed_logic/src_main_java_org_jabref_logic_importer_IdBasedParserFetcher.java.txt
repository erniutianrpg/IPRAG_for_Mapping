The `IdBasedParserFetcher` interface extends `IdBasedFetcher` to provide a standardized three-step process for fetching bibliographic entries by ID:  
1. Constructs a URL from the identifier  
2. Parses the response into `BibEntry` objects  
3. Optionally cleans up the fetched entries.  

It includes default implementations for fetching and post-processing entries, handling errors like malformed URLs, network issues, and parsing failures. The actual URL construction and parsing are delegated to implementing classes.
