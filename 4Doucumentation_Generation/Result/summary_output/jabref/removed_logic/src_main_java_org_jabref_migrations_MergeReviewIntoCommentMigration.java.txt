This code migrates BibTeX entries by merging the 'Review' field into the 'Comment' field. It checks if migration is needed (`needsMigration`), handles non-conflicting entries (`performMigration`), and identifies/processes conflicts where both fields exist (`collectConflicts`, `performConflictingMigration`). The `mergeCommentFieldIfPresent` method combines fields with a label, while `updateFields` transfers the review content to the comment field and clears the review field. The migration tracks changes via `ParserResult`.
