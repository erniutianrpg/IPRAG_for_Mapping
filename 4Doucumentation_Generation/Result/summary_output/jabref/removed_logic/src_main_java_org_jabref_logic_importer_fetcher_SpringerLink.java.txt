This code implements a `FulltextFetcher` for SpringerLink, which searches for PDF URLs of academic papers using Springer's API. It first checks if the BibEntry has a DOI, then queries Springer's API with the DOI. If found, it constructs a PDF URL. The fetcher uses an API key (either from preferences or a default) and handles request failures gracefully. It returns the PDF URL if available, otherwise an empty result. The trust level is set to PUBLISHER, indicating high reliability.
