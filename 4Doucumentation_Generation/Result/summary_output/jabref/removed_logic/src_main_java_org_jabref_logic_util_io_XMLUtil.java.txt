The `XMLUtil` class provides utility methods for working with XML documents in Java. It includes functionality to:
1. Print XML documents to standard output for debugging
2. Convert NodeLists to iterable Lists
3. Retrieve content from specific nodes or attributes
4. Find nodes by name (returning either a list or the first match)
5. Handle XML parsing with proper error logging

The class is primarily used for debugging and test case generation, with methods that simplify common XML operations like node traversal and content extraction.
