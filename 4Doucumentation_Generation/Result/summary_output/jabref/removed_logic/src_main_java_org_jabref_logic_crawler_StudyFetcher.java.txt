The `StudyFetcher` class coordinates parallel searches across multiple e-library fetchers for given search queries. For each query, it retrieves bibliographic entries (up to 100 per fetcher) from each fetcher, handling both paged and non-paged fetchers. Results are aggregated by query and fetcher, with failed fetchers skipped. The output is a list of `QueryResult` objects, each containing fetcher-specific `BibDatabase` results for a query. Errors are logged but don't halt execution.
