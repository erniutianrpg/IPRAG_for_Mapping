The `TemplateExporter` class is a base class for export formats in JabRef that use template-based layouts. It handles exporting bibliographic entries to files by:

1. Loading layout templates from specified directories (either built-in or custom)
2. Processing entries with header, footer, and type-specific layouts
3. Supporting custom formatters and blank line handling
4. Sorting entries based on configuration
5. Writing the formatted output to a file in UTF-8 encoding

The class manages the entire export workflow, from template loading to final file generation, while providing flexibility for different export formats through customizable templates.
