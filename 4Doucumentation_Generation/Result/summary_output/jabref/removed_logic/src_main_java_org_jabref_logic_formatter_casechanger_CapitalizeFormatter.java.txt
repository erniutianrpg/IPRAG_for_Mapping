The `CapitalizeFormatter` class converts the first letter of each word to uppercase and the rest to lowercase, except for words starting with "{". It extends `Formatter` and overrides methods to provide its name, key, description, and example. For example, "I have {a} DREAM" would become "I Have {a} Dream". Words in curly braces remain unchanged.
