The `BracketChecker` class checks if curly brackets `{}` in a string are properly balanced. It verifies that every opening bracket `{` has a corresponding closing bracket `}` and returns an error message if there's an unmatched closing bracket or unclosed opening bracket. If the string is empty or brackets are balanced, it returns no error. This is commonly used for validating syntax in text fields.
