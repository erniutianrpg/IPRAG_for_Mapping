This code provides utility methods for handling file name uniqueness. The `getNonOverWritingFileName` method generates a unique filename by appending a counter (e.g., " (1)") if a file already exists. The `isDuplicatedFile` method checks if a file's content matches any existing file with a similar name, deleting duplicates if found. The `eraseDuplicateMarks` method removes counter suffixes from filenames (e.g., converts "file (1)" back to "file"). These methods help manage file conflicts in a directory.
