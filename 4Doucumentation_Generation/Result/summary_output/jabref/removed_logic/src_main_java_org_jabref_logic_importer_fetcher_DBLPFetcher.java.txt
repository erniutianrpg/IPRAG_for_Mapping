The `DBLPFetcher` class implements a fetcher for retrieving BibTeX entries from the DBLP (dblp.org) academic bibliography database. It constructs a search URL using a Lucene query transformer, fetches results in BibTeX format, and parses them. Post-processing includes DOI cleanup, timestamp clearing, and LaTeX command removal from URLs. The fetcher supports fetching up to 100 entries per query and provides help documentation.
