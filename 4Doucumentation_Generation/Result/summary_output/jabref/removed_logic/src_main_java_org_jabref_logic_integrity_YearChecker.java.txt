The `YearChecker` class validates whether a given string represents a valid year according to BibTeX standards. It checks two conditions: 1) the string must contain a four-digit number, and 2) the last four non-punctuation characters must be numerals. If either check fails, it returns an appropriate error message. Otherwise, it returns an empty `Optional`, indicating the year is valid. This ensures compliance with BibTeX's year format requirements, which allow optional punctuation before the four-digit year.
