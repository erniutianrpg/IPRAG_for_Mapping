The `PostgreSQLProcessor` class manages PostgreSQL database interactions for JabRef, handling schema setup, table creation, and data synchronization. It creates tables for entries, fields, and metadata, migrates data between versions, and inserts BibTeX entries. It also implements a notification system using `LISTEN/NOTIFY` to synchronize changes across clients. Key features include version management, escaping SQL identifiers, and starting/stopping a listener for real-time updates.
