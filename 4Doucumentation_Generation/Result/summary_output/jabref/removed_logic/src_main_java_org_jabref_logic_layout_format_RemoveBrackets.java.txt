The `RemoveBrackets` class implements a `LayoutFormatter` that removes curly braces (`{` and `}`) from a given string. For example, it transforms `"{Stefan Kolb}"` into `"Stefan Kolb"`. It iterates through each character of the input string, appending only non-bracket characters to the result. The formatted string is then returned without any curly braces.
