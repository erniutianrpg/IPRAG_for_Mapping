The `BuildInfo` class retrieves and stores build-related information and system properties for an application. It loads properties from a file (default: `/build.properties`), including version, maintainers, API keys, and Java version requirements. It also captures OS details (name, version, architecture) and Java version from system properties. Default values are provided for missing properties. The class uses a helper method to clean property values by removing Gradle variable references.
