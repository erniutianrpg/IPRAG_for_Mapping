The `EscapeDollarSignFormatter` class escapes unescaped dollar signs (`$`) in a string by replacing them with a backslash (`\$`). It extends a `Formatter` class, providing metadata like name, key, description, and example input. The `format` method processes the input string, ensuring all `$` not already preceded by a backslash are escaped. For example, `Text$with$dollar$sign` becomes `Text\$with\$dollar\$sign`.
