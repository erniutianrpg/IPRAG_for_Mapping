This code defines a `SaveOrder` class that manages sorting configurations for saving entries in JabRef. It supports three order types: SPECIFIED (custom field-based sorting), ORIGINAL (original entry order), and TABLE (default table order). The class stores sorting criteria (field + ascending/descending) and provides methods to parse, convert, and compare these configurations. The nested `SortCriterion` class represents individual sorting rules. Key functionality includes parsing from string lists, default order creation, and conversion to string lists for storage.
