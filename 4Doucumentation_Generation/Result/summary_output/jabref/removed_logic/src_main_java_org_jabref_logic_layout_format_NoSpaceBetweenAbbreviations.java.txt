This code defines a `LayoutFormatter` that removes spaces between abbreviated first names. For example, it converts "J. R. R. Tolkien" to "J.R.R. Tolkien". The formatter uses a regular expression to find patterns of a dot followed by spaces and an uppercase letter (before another dot) and replaces them with a dot directly followed by the letter. The operation preserves the final dot using a lookahead assertion.
