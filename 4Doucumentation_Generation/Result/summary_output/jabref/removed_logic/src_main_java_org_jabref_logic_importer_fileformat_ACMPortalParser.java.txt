The `ACMPortalParser` class parses ACM Portal search results to extract bibliographic entries (BibTeX format). It processes HTML search results to extract DOIs, then queries ACM's API with these DOIs to fetch citation data in JSON format. The JSON is converted into `BibEntry` objects, mapping fields like author, title, DOI, and publication details. Key steps include parsing DOIs from HTML, constructing API requests, and transforming JSON responses into structured bibliography entries.
