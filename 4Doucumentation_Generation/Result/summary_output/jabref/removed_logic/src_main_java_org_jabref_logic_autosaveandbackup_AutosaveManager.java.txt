The `AutosaveManager` class provides automatic saving functionality for a `BibDatabaseContext`. It listens for database changes (`BibDatabaseContextChangedEvent`) and schedules periodic autosaves (every 31 seconds) via `AutosaveEvent`. It uses a `ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor` to prevent high load and avoid redundant saves. Running instances are tracked, and the manager can be started/shutdown for specific databases. Listeners can be registered/unregistered to handle autosave events. The class ensures efficient, non-redundant autosaving while managing resources properly.
