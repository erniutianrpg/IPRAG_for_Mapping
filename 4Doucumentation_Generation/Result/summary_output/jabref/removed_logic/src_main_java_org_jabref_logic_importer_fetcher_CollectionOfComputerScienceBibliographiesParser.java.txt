This code implements a parser for fetching and processing bibliographic entries from the Collection of Computer Science Bibliographies (CCSB) website. It extracts BibTeX entries from HTML pages by:

1. Finding item links in the HTML input stream using regex
2. Downloading each linked page and extracting BibTeX data (wrapped in `<pre class="bibtex">` tags)
3. Converting HTML entities to Unicode
4. Parsing the combined BibTeX data into `BibEntry` objects using a `BibtexParser`

The parser handles HTML-to-Unicode conversion and uses regex patterns to locate relevant data in the HTML structure.
