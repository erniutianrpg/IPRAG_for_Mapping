The `PdfEmbeddedBibFileImporter` class extracts and parses BibTeX entries embedded in PDF files. It checks for embedded files in both the PDF's document catalog and annotations, then processes any found BibTeX files using a `BibtexParser`. The importer handles encrypted PDFs by throwing an error and supports PDF file type recognition. It returns parsed entries as a `ParserResult`. Key methods include `importDatabase` for file processing and `getEmbeddedBibFileEntries` for extraction.
