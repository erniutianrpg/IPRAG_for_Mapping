The `UnitsToLatexFormatter` class converts unit notations in text to LaTeX-compatible formatting. It handles various units (e.g., Hz, m, W) and prefixes (e.g., k, m, Î¼), adding curly braces to preserve case and replacing spaces/hyphens with non-breaking versions. For example, "1 Hz" becomes "1~\{Hz\}" and "12-bit" becomes "12\mbox{-}\{bit\}". This ensures proper LaTeX rendering while maintaining unit case sensitivity. The formatter supports a predefined list of units and prefixes, sorted by string length for efficient processing.
