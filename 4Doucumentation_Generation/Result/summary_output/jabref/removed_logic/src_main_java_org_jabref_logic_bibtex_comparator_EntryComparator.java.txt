The `EntryComparator` class implements a comparator for sorting BibTeX entries in JabRef. It supports sorting by a specified field (e.g., author, title, or numeric fields) with options for binary (presence/absence) or content-based comparison, ascending/descending order, and chaining to another comparator for tie-breaking. If entries are equal, it falls back to comparing unique IDs. Special handling is included for person names (rearranged by last name), entry types, and numeric fields. The comparator forms a linked list of comparators for multi-level sorting.
