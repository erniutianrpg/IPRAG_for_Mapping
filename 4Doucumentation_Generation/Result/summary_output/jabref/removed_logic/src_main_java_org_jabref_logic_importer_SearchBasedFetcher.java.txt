The `SearchBasedFetcher` interface extends `WebFetcher` and provides methods to search web resources for bibliographic data (`BibEntry`). It supports both complex fielded queries (via `performSearch(QueryNode)`) and free-text queries (via `performSearch(String)`), which are parsed into Lucene query nodes. If the query string is blank, it returns an empty list. Errors during parsing throw a `FetcherException`. This interface is designed for sources that return BibTeX data directly.
