The `TrimWhitespaceFormatter` class trims all leading and trailing whitespace characters (as defined by Java's `String.trim()`) from a given string. It extends a `Formatter` class, providing metadata like name, key, description, and example input for localization and documentation purposes. The core functionality is in the `format` method, which uses `String.trim()` on the input after null-checking. Example: input `"\r\n InCDMA\n\r "` becomes `"InCDMA"`. (97 words)
