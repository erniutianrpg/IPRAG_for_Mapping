The `LocalizationKeyParams` class handles localization with placeholder replacement. It takes a localization key and up to 10 parameters, validates the parameter count, and replaces placeholders (`%0`, `%1`, etc.) in the key's translation with the provided parameters. The `replacePlaceholders` method iterates through the parameters, substituting each placeholder with its corresponding value. This enables dynamic text generation for localized strings.
