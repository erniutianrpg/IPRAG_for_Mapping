The `FirstPage` class extracts the first page number from a "pages" field string. If the input is null, it returns an empty string. For valid inputs like "345-360" or "345--360", it splits the string by spaces or hyphens and returns the first part ("345"). If there aren't exactly two parts, it returns the original string unchanged. This is useful for displaying just the starting page of a page range.
