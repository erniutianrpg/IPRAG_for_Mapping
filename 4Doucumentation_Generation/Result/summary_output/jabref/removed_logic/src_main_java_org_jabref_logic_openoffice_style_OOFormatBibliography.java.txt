This code generates formatted bibliographies for OpenOffice documents. It handles:

1. Creating bibliography titles and entries with proper styling
2. Formatting individual bibliography entries with labels, reference text, and "Cited on pages" sections
3. Managing unique identifiers for entries
4. Sorting and formatting citation references with page numbers
5. Supporting both numbered and key-based citation styles

The code uses layout templates to format references and maintains citation group information to create proper cross-references within the document.
