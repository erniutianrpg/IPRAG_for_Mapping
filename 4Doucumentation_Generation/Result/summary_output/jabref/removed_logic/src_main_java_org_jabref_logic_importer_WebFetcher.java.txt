This code defines a `WebFetcher` interface for fetching bibliographic data from web resources. It includes methods to get the fetcher's localized name (`getName()`), an optional help page (`getHelpPage()`), and a default method to create a URL downloader (`getUrlDownload()`). The interface serves as a base for implementing specific web fetchers, allowing customization of download behavior if needed. Default implementations are provided for helper methods.
