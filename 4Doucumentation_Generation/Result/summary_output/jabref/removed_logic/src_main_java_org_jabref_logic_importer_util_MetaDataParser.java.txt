The `MetaDataParser` class processes metadata for a BibTeX database, handling various metadata fields like file directories, citation key patterns, save actions, and groups. It parses custom entry types and organizes metadata into a `MetaData` object. Key functionalities include parsing key-value pairs from a map, validating single items, and handling escape sequences in metadata values. The class ensures groups are processed last and supports legacy metadata formats. It throws `ParseException` for invalid data.
