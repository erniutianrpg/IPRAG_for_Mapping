The `AuthorList` class parses and manages author/editor names in BibTeX format. It provides methods to:
1. Parse raw author strings into `Author` objects
2. Format names in various styles (Last-First, First-Last, Last-only)
3. Handle abbreviations, Oxford commas, and conjunctions ("and")
4. Support LaTeX-free versions and alphabetization
5. Cache parsed results for efficiency

The class is immutable and follows BibTeX parsing rules while handling edge cases and name formatting consistently. It offers convenience methods for common formatting needs in academic citations.
