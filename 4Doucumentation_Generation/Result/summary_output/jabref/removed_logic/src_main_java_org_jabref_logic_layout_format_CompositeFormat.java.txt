The `CompositeFormat` class implements a composite layout formatter that sequentially applies multiple `LayoutFormatter` instances to a given string. It can be initialized with zero (no-op), two, or an array of formatters. When formatting text (`format` method), it processes the input through each formatter in order, passing the output of one as input to the next, and returns the final result. Essentially, it chains formatters together for cumulative text transformations.
