This code implements a fetcher for MathSciNet, a mathematical literature database. It can:

1. Search entries by query, identifier (MR number), or BibEntry fields (title, author, etc.)
2. Parse HTML responses to extract BibTeX data
3. Perform post-cleanup on fetched entries (field moves, formatting, etc.)
4. Use MR Lookup for better partial-matching when full MR number isn't available

The fetcher implements three interfaces: `SearchBasedParserFetcher`, `EntryBasedParserFetcher`, and `IdBasedParserFetcher` to support different search methods, all returning BibTeX formatted results.
