The `IndexingTaskManager` class manages background PDF indexing tasks for a bibliography database. It queues indexing operations (create, update, add, remove) and executes them asynchronously using a `TaskExecutor`. It tracks progress, shows user notifications, and allows blocking new tasks temporarily. The class ensures thread-safe operations via synchronization and updates the index based on changes to PDF files linked to bibliography entries.
