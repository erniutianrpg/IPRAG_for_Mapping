The `AbbreviationWriter` class provides a static method `writeOrCreate` to write a list of journal abbreviations to a CSV file. It creates or overwrites the file at the given path, using UTF-8 encoding. Each entry is written as a CSV record with the journal name and abbreviation(s), including the shortest unique abbreviation if it's not the default. The class uses Apache Commons CSV for formatting.
