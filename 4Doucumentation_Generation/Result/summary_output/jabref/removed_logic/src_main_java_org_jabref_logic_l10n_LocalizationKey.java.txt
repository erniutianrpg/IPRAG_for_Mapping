The `LocalizationKey` class manages localization keys for translation, where the key is English text. It handles escaping special characters (spaces, #, !, =, :) and newlines for properties file compatibility. The class provides methods to create keys from plain or escaped strings and to retrieve the original or escaped versions. Key functionality includes escaping characters for property files while preserving the original key.
