The `FieldContentFormatter` class reformats BibTeX field content by normalizing whitespace (replacing any whitespace sequences with single spaces) for most fields. However, it preserves the original formatting for specific multi-line fields like `ABSTRACT`, `COMMENT`, `REVIEW`, and any fields marked as non-wrappable in `FieldPreferences`. This undoes formatting applied by JabRef when writing fields, ensuring consistent reading of BibTeX entries.
