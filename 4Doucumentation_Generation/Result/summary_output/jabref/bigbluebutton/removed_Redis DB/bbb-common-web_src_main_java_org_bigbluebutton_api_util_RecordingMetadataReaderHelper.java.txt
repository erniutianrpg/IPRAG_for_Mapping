The `RecordingMetadataReaderHelper` class acts as a helper for managing recording metadata in BigBlueButton. It provides methods to validate text track tokens, retrieve/upload text tracks, fetch recording metadata from XML files, and save metadata. The class delegates most operations to a `RecordingServiceGW` instance, handling tasks like processing captions, managing recordings in 2x format, and interacting with metadata files. It serves as an intermediary between the API and the core recording service.
