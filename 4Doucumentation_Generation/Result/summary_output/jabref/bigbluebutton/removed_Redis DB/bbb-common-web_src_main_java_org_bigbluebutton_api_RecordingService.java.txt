The `RecordingService` interface defines methods for managing recordings in BigBlueButton, including text track validation, recording retrieval with pagination, state changes, metadata updates, and processing of downloadable presentations. It supports operations like checking recording existence, updating captions, and handling recording lifecycle events (start, end, chapter breaks). The interface also provides a default method for converting lists to paginated results.
