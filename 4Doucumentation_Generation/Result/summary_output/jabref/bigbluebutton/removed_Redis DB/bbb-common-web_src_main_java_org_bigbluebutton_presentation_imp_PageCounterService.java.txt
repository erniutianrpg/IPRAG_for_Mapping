The `PageCounterService` class counts and validates the number of pages in an uploaded presentation. For PDF files, it delegates page counting to a `PageCounter` instance, while image files are treated as single-page documents. It enforces a maximum page limit (`maxNumPages`) and throws exceptions if the count is invalid (â‰¤0) or exceeds the limit. The service ensures presentations meet page constraints before processing.
