The `UserLockedInMeeting` class is a message structure that communicates when a user's lock status changes in a meeting. It contains three fields: `meetingId` (identifies the meeting), `userId` (identifies the user), and `locked` (boolean indicating if the user is locked/unlocked). This immutable data class implements `IMessage` for messaging system compatibility.
