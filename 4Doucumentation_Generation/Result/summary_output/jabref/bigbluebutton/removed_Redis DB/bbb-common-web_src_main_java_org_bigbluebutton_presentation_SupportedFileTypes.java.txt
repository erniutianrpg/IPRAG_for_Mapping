This code defines supported file types for presentations in BigBlueButton. It maintains lists of supported file extensions (office docs, PDFs, images) and provides methods to:
1. Check if a file extension is supported
2. Detect a file's MIME type using Linux's `file` command (falling back to Java methods if needed)
3. Validate if a file's MIME type matches its extension
The class helps ensure only valid presentation files are processed by the system.
