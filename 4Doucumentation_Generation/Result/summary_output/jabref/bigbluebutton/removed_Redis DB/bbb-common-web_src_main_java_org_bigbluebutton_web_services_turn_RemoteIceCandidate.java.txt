The `RemoteIceCandidate` class is a simple Java data structure that holds information about a remote ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment) candidate. It contains a single public final field `ip` to store the IP address, which is set once via the constructor and cannot be modified afterward. This class is likely used in WebRTC applications to represent remote network candidates for establishing peer-to-peer connections. (59 words)
