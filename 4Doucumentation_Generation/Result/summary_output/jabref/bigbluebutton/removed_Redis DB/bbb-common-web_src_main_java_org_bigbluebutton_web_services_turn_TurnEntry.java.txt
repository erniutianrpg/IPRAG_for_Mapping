The `TurnEntry` class is a simple data container that stores TURN server credentials and configuration. It holds four immutable fields: `username` (authentication username), `url` (server URL), `password` (authentication password), and `ttl` (time-to-live in seconds). The values are set once via the constructor and cannot be modified afterward. The commented-out getter methods suggest they were deemed unnecessary, likely because the fields are declared public. This class appears to be used for passing TURN server connection details in a BigBlueButton web service. (98 words)
