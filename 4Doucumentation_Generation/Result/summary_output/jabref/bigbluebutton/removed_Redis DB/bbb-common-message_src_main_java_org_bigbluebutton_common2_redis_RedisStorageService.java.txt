This code implements a Redis storage service for BigBlueButton, handling meeting data and captions. It provides methods to:
1. Start/stop Redis connections
2. Generate/validate single-use caption tokens
3. Record meeting info, breakout rooms, and presentations
4. Store presentation annotations
5. Manage recording expiration
6. Check connection status

The service uses Redis hashes and lists to store structured data like meeting details, recordings, and export jobs, with support for data expiration.
