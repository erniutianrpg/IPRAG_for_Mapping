The code defines a `GuestPolicy` class that contains string constants representing different guest access policies in a meeting system. It includes policies like always accepting or denying guests, asking moderators for approval, and always accepting authenticated users. Additionally, it provides constants for guest response statuses: ALLOW, DENY, and WAIT. These constants are used to manage guest permissions and responses uniformly across the application.
