The `RecordingImportHandler` class imports and processes recording metadata from XML files. It scans a specified directory for recordings, checks if they exist in the data store, and imports new recordings by parsing their `metadata.xml` files into `Recording` objects using an `XmlService`. The imported recordings are optionally persisted to the data store. The class follows a singleton pattern and logs operations using SLF4J. Key methods include `importRecordings` (batch import) and `importRecording` (single file import).
