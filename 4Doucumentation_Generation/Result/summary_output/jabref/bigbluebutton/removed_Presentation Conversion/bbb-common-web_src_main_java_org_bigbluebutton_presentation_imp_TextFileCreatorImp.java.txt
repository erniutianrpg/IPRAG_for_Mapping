This code creates text files from presentation slides (PDF or images) for the BigBlueButton conferencing system. For images, it generates a placeholder text file. For PDFs, it uses the `pdftotext` command to extract text from a specific page. The text files are saved in a "textfiles" subdirectory. It handles errors during text extraction and logs analytics data if the process fails. The main method `createTextFile` orchestrates this process by checking directories, generating files, and returning success status.
