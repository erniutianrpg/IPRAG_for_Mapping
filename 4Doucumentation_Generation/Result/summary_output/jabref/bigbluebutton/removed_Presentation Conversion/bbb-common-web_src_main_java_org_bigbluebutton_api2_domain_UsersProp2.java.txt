The `UsersProp2` class is a data container representing user-related properties in a meeting context. It stores settings like guest policy, meeting layout, webcam restrictions, user capacity, and camera limits. It also holds collections of custom user data, active users (`User2` objects), and registered users with timestamps. The class is immutable (fields are final) and initialized via constructor.
