This code implements a TURN server utility for generating temporary credentials (username and password) for WebRTC connections. The `TurnServer` class uses HMAC-SHA1 to create a secure password by combining a user ID with an expiry timestamp. The username is formatted as `expiryTime:userId`, and the password is an HMAC-SHA1 signature of the username, base64-encoded. These credentials, along with the TURN server URL and time-to-live (TTL), are returned as a `TurnEntry` object for secure access to the TURN server.
