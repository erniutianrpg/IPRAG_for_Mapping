The `RecordingImportHandler` class imports recording metadata from XML files in a specified directory. It uses a singleton pattern to manage instances and relies on `DataStore` for persistence and `XmlService` for XML parsing. Key functionalities include:

1. Scanning a directory for recordings
2. Checking for existing recordings to avoid duplicates
3. Reading and parsing metadata.xml files
4. Converting XML to Recording objects
5. Optionally persisting recordings to the DataStore

The main methods are `importRecordings` (batch import) and `importRecording` (single file import), both supporting a `persist` flag to control storage.
