The code defines a `DeletedRecordingMessage` class that represents a message for a deleted recording event. It includes constants for the event name (`DELETED_RECORDING_EVENT`) and version (`VERSION`), and a `recordId` field to store the ID of the deleted recording. The class constructor initializes the `recordId`. This is likely used in a messaging system to notify about recording deletions. (60 words)
