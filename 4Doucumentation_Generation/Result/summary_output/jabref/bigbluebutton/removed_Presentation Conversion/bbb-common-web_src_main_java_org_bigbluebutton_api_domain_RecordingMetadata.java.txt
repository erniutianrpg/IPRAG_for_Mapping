The `RecordingMetadata` class acts as a wrapper for `RecMeta` objects, providing methods to get/set recording metadata. It allows setting the recording state (like started/stopped), published status (true/false), and a map of key-value metadata pairs. All operations delegate to the underlying `RecMeta` instance, which handles the actual data storage and manipulation. Essentially, it's a simple interface for managing recording metadata in a BigBlueButton API context.
