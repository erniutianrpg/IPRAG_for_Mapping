This Java code checks PowerPoint presentation files (PPTX) for three potential issues: 1) whether they contain embedded EMF images, 2) if they have a small background tile image, and 3) if all slides are hidden. It uses Apache POI to parse the PPTX file and performs these checks using custom predicates. The program exits with status code 0 if valid, 2 if issues are found, or 1 for file reading errors.
