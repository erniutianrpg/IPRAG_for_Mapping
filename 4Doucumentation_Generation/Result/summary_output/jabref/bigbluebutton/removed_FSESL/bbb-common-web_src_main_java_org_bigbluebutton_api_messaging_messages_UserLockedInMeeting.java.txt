The `UserLockedInMeeting` class is a message structure in a messaging system that communicates when a user's lock status changes in a meeting. It contains three fields: `meetingId` (identifies the meeting), `userId` (identifies the user), and `locked` (boolean indicating if the user is locked/unlocked). The class implements `IMessage` and initializes these fields via its constructor. This message is likely used to synchronize user lock states across systems. (98 words)
