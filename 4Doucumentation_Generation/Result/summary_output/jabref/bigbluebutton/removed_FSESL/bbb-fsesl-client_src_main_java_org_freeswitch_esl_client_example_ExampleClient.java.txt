This Java code demonstrates a basic FreeSWITCH ESL (Event Socket Library) client that connects to a FreeSWITCH server (localhost:8021) using a password. It subscribes to all events, filters for specific event types (heartbeat, custom, background_job), and includes a simple console interface to quit (via 'q' command). The client can be closed gracefully, though heartbeat functionality (commented out) isn't fully implemented. The code primarily shows ESL connection setup, event handling, and basic client management.
