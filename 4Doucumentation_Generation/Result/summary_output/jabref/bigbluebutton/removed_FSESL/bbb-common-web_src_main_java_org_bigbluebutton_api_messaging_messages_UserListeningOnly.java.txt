The `UserListeningOnly` class is a message implementation that tracks whether a user in a meeting is in listen-only mode. It contains three fields: `meetingId` (identifies the meeting), `userId` (identifies the user), and `listenOnly` (boolean indicating listen-only status). The constructor initializes these values. This class is used to communicate user audio state changes in a messaging system. (Words: 50)
