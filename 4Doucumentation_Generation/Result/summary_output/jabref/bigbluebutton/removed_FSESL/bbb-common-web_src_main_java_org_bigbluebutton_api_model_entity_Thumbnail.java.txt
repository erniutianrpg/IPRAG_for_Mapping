This Java code defines a `Thumbnail` JPA entity representing a thumbnail image in a database. It stores attributes like `id`, `height`, `width`, `alt` text, `url`, and `sequence`, with a many-to-one relationship to `PlaybackFormat`. The class includes standard getters/setters, `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` methods. It implements `Comparable` to sort thumbnails by their sequence number. The entity maps to a `thumbnails` table in the database.
