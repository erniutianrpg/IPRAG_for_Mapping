The code defines a simple Java class `EndMeetingMessage` that represents a message to end a meeting. It contains constants for the event type (`END_MEETING_REQUEST_EVENT`) and version (`VERSION`), and a field `meetingId` to store the meeting identifier. The constructor initializes the `meetingId` when creating an instance of this message. This class serves as a data structure for end-meeting requests in a messaging system. (74 words)
