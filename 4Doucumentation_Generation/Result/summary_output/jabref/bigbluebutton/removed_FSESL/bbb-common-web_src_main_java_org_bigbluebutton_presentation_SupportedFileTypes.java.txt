This code defines supported file types for presentations in BigBlueButton. It maintains lists of supported office documents (XLS, DOC, PPT, etc.), PDFs, and image files (JPG, PNG). Key functions include checking if a file extension is supported (`isFileSupported`), detecting a file's MIME type using a Linux command (`detectMimeType`), and validating if a file's MIME type matches its extension (`isPresentationMimeTypeValid`). If MIME detection fails, it falls back to Java's native methods. The code ensures only valid, expected file types are processed.
