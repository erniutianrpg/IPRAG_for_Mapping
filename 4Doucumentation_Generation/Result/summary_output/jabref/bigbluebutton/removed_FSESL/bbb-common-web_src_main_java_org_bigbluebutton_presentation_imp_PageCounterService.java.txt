The `PageCounterService` class counts and validates the number of pages in uploaded presentations. For PDF files, it delegates page counting to a `PageCounter` instance, while image files are treated as single-page documents. It enforces a maximum page limit (default 100) and throws exceptions if the page count is invalid (â‰¤0) or exceeds the limit. The service supports configuration of the max pages and page counter implementation via setter methods.
