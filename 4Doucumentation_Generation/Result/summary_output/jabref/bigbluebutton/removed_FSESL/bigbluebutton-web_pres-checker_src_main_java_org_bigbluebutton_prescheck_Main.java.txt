This Java code checks PowerPoint files (PPTX) for three potential issues: 1) embedded EMF images, 2) small background tile images, and 3) all slides being hidden. It uses Apache POI to parse the file and Apache Commons Collections for filtering. The program exits with status 0 if valid, 2 if issues are found, or 1 for errors. Each check is implemented as a predicate that scans specific file attributes.
