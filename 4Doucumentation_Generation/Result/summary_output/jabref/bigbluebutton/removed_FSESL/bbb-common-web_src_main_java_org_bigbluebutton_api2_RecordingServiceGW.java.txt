This code defines a `RecordingServiceGW` interface for handling recording-related operations in a BigBlueButton system. It provides methods to: retrieve recordings in a 2.x format, fetch/save recording metadata from/to XML files, validate text track tokens, get/upload recording text tracks, and manage caption files. The interface supports both Java and Scala (via `scala.Option`) interoperability. Key functionalities include metadata management, text track handling, and recording retrieval.
