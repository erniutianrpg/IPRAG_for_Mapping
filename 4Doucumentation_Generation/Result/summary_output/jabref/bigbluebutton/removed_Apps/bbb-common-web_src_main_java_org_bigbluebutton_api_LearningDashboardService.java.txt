This code manages learning dashboard data for BigBlueButton meetings. It provides functionality to: 1) Create and write JSON data files containing activity data for meetings, stored in a specific directory structure; 2) Remove these files after a configurable delay; and 3) Clean up directories recursively. The service uses meeting IDs and access tokens to organize files and includes error handling and logging.
