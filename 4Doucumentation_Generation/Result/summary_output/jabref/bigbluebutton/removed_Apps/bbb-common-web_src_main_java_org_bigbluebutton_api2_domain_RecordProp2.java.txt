The `RecordProp2` class is a simple data container that holds three boolean properties related to recording settings: `record` (whether recording is enabled), `autoStartRecording` (whether recording starts automatically), and `allowStartStopRecording` (whether manual start/stop of recording is allowed). It provides a constructor to initialize these immutable properties.
