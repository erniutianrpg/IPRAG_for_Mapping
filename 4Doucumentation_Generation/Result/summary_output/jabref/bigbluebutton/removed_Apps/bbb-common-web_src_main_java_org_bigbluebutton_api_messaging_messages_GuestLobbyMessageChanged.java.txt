The `GuestLobbyMessageChanged` class is a message implementation that holds data about a changed lobby message for a specific meeting. It contains two fields: `meetingId` (identifies the meeting) and `message` (the updated lobby message). The constructor initializes these fields. This class appears to be part of a messaging system for notifying about guest lobby message updates. (58 words)
