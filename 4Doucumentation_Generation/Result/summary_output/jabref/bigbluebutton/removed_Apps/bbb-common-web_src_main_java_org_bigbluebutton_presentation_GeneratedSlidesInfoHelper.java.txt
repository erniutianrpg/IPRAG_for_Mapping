This code defines a Java interface `GeneratedSlidesInfoHelper` with a single method `generateUploadedPresentationInfo` that takes an `UploadedPresentation` object as input and returns a String. The interface appears to be part of the BigBlueButton presentation system, likely used to generate information or metadata about uploaded presentation slides. The exact functionality isn't specified, but it serves as a contract for generating presentation-related information.
