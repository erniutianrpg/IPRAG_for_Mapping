The `Extension` class represents a generic extension object with a type (string) and properties (key-value pairs). It provides getter and setter methods to access and modify these fields. This simple data structure is likely used to store and manage extension-related information in the BigBlueButton conferencing system. The class encapsulates the extension's type and its associated properties in a Map.
