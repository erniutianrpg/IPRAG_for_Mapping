The `DataStore` class is a singleton that manages database operations using Hibernate. It provides CRUD functionality for entities like `Recording`, `Metadata`, `PlaybackFormat`, etc. Key methods include saving/deleting entities, finding records by ID, and querying recordings by meeting ID, state, or metadata filters. It handles transactions with rollback on errors and ensures proper session cleanup. The class initializes a Hibernate session factory with annotated entity classes upon instantiation.
