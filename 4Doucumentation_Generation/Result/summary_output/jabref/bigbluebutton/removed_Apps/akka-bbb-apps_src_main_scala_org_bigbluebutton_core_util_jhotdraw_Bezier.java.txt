The `Bezier` class provides algorithms for fitting smooth Bezier curves to a set of digitized points (like hand-drawn strokes). Key functionalities include:

1. **Curve Fitting**: Uses Philip J. Schneider's algorithm to approximate Bezier curves that match input points within a specified error tolerance.
2. **Preprocessing**: Cleans input data by removing close points, reducing noise, and splitting paths at sharp corners.
3. **Mathematical Operations**: Includes vector math utilities (normalization, scaling, etc.) and Bezier curve calculations.
4. **Optimization**: Implements Newton-Raphson iteration for parameter refinement to improve curve fitting.

The class is utility-based (no instantiation) and focuses on converting rough sketches into smooth Bezier paths.
