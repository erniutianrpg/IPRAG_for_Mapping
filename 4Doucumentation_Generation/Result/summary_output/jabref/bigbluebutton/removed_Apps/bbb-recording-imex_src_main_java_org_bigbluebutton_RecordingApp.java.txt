This Java application handles importing and exporting recording metadata for BigBlueButton. It operates in two modes: 
1. **Command-line mode**: Processes flags (-e for export, -i for import with persist option, -s for single recording) and a path argument.
2. **Interactive mode**: Guides users through import/export choices with prompts. 

The app uses `RecordingImportHandler` and `RecordingExportHandler` to perform operations, supporting both batch and individual recording processing. Default paths are created if none specified. Error handling includes input validation and directory creation checks.
