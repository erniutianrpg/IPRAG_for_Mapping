The code defines a `Preview` class that represents a collection of images. It uses Jackson XML annotations to map an array of `Image` objects to an XML structure where the images are wrapped in an `<images>` parent element with each individual image as an `<image>` child element. The class provides getter and setter methods for accessing and modifying the image array.
