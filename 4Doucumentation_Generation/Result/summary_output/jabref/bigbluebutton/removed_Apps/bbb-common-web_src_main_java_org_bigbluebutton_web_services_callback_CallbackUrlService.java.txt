This code implements a callback URL service that processes meeting-ended events by making HTTP GET requests to specified callback URLs. It features:

1. A queue system with delayed retries (30 sec, 1 min, 2 min, 5 min) for failed callbacks
2. Asynchronous HTTP client to make callback requests
3. Logging of success/failure analytics in JSON format
4. Automatic retry logic (up to 5 attempts) before giving up
5. Threaded processing of callback events

The service handles callback URL verification, follows redirects (up to 5), and logs all attempts and outcomes.
