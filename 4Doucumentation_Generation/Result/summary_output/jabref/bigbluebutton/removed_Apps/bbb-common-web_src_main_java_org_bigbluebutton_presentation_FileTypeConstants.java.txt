This code defines a Java class `FileTypeConstants` that serves as a collection of constant strings representing various file extensions (e.g., DOCX, PPT, PDF, JPG). These constants are used to identify supported file types in the BigBlueButton presentation system. The class is final with a private constructor to prevent instantiation, acting purely as a utility for file type references. (98 words)
