The `MeetingsResponse` class is a simple container that holds a collection of `MeetingResponseDetail` objects. It provides a constructor to initialize this collection and exposes it as a public final field, making the data immutable after creation. This class serves as a response structure for returning meeting details in an API. (49 words)
