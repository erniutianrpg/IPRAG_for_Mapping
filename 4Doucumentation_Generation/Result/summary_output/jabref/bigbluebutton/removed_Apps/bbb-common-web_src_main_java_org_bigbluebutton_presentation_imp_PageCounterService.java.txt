The `PageCounterService` class counts and validates the number of pages in uploaded presentations. For PDF files, it delegates page counting to a `PageCounter` instance, while image files are treated as single-page documents. It enforces a configurable maximum page limit (default 100) and throws exceptions if the page count is invalid (â‰¤0) or exceeds the limit. The service supports PDF and image file types, with results stored in the `UploadedPresentation` object.
