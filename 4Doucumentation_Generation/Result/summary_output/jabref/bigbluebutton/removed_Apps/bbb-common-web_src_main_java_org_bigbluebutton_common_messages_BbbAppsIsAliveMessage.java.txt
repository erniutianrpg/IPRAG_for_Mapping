This Java class `BbbAppsIsAliveMessage` represents a heartbeat message for BigBlueButton apps, indicating they're alive. It includes timestamps for when the message was sent (`timestamp`) and when the app started (`startedOn`). The class provides methods to convert the message to JSON (`toJson()`) and parse it from JSON (`fromJson()`), ensuring proper message structure validation. The message follows a specific format with header and payload sections, using constants for field names and versioning.
