The `BezierPath` class represents a path consisting of straight lines, quadratic curves, and cubic curves (Bézier curves). It stores nodes with up to three control points (C0, C1, C2) where C0 is the point the path passes through, and C1/C2 control the incoming/outgoing curves. Key features include:

- Supports open/closed paths with customizable winding rules
- Provides methods for path manipulation (add, move, split, join segments)
- Converts between Bézier curves and other representations (polygons, general paths)
- Implements collision detection and point containment checks
- Offers geometric operations like transformations, bounds calculation, and arc creation

The class caches path data for performance and implements Java's `Shape` interface for compatibility with AWT graphics operations.
