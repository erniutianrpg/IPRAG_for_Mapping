This code defines a `HTML5ProcessLine` class that parses process information for BigBlueButton HTML5 backend instances. It extracts the instance ID and CPU usage percentage from a process line string (typically from a `ps` command output). The constructor splits the input string to find the CPU percentage and instance ID (marked by `NODEJS_BACKEND_INSTANCE_ID`). The `toString()` method formats these values for display. Essentially, it helps monitor individual HTML5 backend processes' resource usage. (98 words)
