The `UserStatusChanged` class is a message implementation that represents a user's status change in a meeting. It contains four fields: `meetingId` (identifies the meeting), `userId` (identifies the user), `status` (the status type changed), and `value` (the new status value). The class constructor initializes these fields when creating a message instance. This is likely used in a messaging system to notify about user status updates.
