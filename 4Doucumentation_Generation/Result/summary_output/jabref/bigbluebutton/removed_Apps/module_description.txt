This module provides core utilities and messaging infrastructure for BigBlueButton, an open-source webinar system. It includes geometric and vector graphics utilities (Bezier curves, path operations, shape analysis) for whiteboard functionality, along with a comprehensive messaging system for handling meeting events (recording status, user/guest updates, lobby messages). The module also supports recording management through metadata import/export capabilities and presentation validation, while maintaining data persistence via Hibernate-based storage. These components collectively enable real-time collaboration features and recording management within the BigBlueButton ecosystem.
