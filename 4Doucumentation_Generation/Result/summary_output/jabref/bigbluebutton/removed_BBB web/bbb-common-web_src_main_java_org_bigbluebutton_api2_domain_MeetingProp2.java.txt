The `MeetingProp2` class is a simple data container (POJO) that represents meeting properties in a BigBlueButton API. It stores immutable meeting details including name, internal/external IDs, camera limits (capacity and pinned cameras), parent meeting ID, sequence number, and a breakout room flag. The class uses a constructor to initialize all fields and provides no mutator methods, making instances immutable once created.
