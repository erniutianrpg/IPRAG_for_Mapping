This abstract Java class `Checksum` validates and stores checksum-related data for API calls. It includes two required fields (`apiCall` and `checksum`) with `@NotEmpty` validation annotations, sanitizes inputs in the constructor, and provides getters/setters for these fields and an optional `queryStringWithoutChecksum`. The class ensures mandatory checksum validation while allowing extension by subclasses. (98 words)
