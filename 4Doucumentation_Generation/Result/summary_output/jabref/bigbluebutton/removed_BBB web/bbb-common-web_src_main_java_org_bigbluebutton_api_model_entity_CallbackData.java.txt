This code defines a JPA entity `CallbackData` representing callback data in a database table. It includes fields for ID, meeting ID, callback attributes, timestamps (created/updated), and a one-to-one relationship with a `Recording` entity. The class provides getters/setters, equals/hashCode methods for comparison, and a toString method for string representation. Essentially, it models callback metadata storage with relational database mapping.
