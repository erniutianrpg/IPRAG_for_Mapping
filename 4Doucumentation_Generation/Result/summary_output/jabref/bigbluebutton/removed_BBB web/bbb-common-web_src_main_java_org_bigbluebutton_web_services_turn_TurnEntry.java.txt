The `TurnEntry` class is a simple data container that stores TURN server credentials and configuration. It holds four immutable fields: `username`, `url`, `password`, and `ttl` (time-to-live). The constructor initializes these values. The commented-out getter methods suggest they were considered but not needed, possibly due to direct field access. This class appears to be used for managing TURN server authentication details in a WebRTC application. (89 words)
