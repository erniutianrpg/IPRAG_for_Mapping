This code defines a custom `@NotNull` annotation for Java Bean Validation. It marks fields/methods as non-null, triggering validation via `NotNullValidator`. The annotation includes default error messages (`key` and `message`), can be applied to various targets (fields, methods, etc.), supports repeatability via `@Repeatable`, and retains metadata at runtime. It's used to enforce non-null constraints in validation scenarios.
