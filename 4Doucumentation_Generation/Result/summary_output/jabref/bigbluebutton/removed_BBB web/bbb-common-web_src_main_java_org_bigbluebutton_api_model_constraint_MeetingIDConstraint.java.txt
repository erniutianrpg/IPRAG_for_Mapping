This code defines a custom annotation `@MeetingIDConstraint` for validating meeting IDs in Java. It combines multiple validation constraints: the ID must not be empty, must be 2-256 characters long, and cannot contain commas. The annotation is targeted for fields (`FIELD`) and is retained at runtime (`RUNTIME`) for processing by validation frameworks. Default error messages and keys are provided for validation failures. This serves as a reusable constraint for meeting ID validation in API models.
