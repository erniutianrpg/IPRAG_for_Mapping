This code defines a JPA entity class `Recording` that represents meeting recordings in a database. It includes fields for recording details (ID, meeting ID, name, timestamps), status (using an enum for states like published/deleted), and relationships with `Metadata`, `PlaybackFormat`, and `CallbackData` entities. The class provides getters/setters, equals/hashCode methods, and a toString() implementation for proper object handling. It maps to a "recordings" table in the database.
