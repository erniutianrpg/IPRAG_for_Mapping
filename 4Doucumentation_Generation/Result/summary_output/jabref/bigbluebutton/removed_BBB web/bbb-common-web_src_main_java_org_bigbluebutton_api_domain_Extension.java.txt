The `Extension` class represents a generic extension entity with a type (string) and properties (key-value pairs). It provides getter and setter methods for both fields, allowing storage and retrieval of extension data. This simple POJO (Plain Old Java Object) is likely used to handle various extension configurations in the BigBlueButton conferencing system.
