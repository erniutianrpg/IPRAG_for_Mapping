The `TurnServer` class generates TURN server credentials for WebRTC authentication. It creates a username (combining expiry time and user ID) and a password (HMAC-SHA1 signature of the username using a secret key). The credentials include a time-to-live (TTL) and server URL. The `calculateRFC2104HMAC` method computes the Base64-encoded HMAC signature for security. This enables secure, temporary access to TURN servers for media relay.
