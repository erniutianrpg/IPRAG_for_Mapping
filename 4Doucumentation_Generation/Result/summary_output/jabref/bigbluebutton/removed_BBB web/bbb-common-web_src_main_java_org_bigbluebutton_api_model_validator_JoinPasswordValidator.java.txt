The `JoinPasswordValidator` class validates whether a provided join password matches either the moderator or attendee password for a meeting. It checks if the meeting exists using the meeting ID, then compares the provided password against the stored moderator and attendee passwords. While it logs password details, it currently always returns `true` (likely a placeholder for actual validation logic). The validator implements Java's `ConstraintValidator` for custom annotation-based validation.
