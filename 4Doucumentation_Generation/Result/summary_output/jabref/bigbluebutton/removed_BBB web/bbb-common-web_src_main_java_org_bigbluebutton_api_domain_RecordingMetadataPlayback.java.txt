This Java class `RecordingMetadataPlayback` represents playback metadata for recordings in a BigBlueButton API. It stores information like format, link, processing time, duration, extensions, and size of a recording playback. The class includes getter/setter methods for each field and a `calculateDuration()` method that converts duration from milliseconds to minutes. It uses Jackson XML annotations (`@JacksonXmlRootElement`, `@JacksonXmlProperty`) for XML serialization/deserialization. The class serves as a data container for recording playback metadata.
