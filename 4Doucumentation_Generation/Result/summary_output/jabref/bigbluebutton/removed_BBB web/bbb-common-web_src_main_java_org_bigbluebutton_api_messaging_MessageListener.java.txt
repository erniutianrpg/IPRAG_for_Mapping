This code defines a `MessageListener` interface with a single method `handle(IMessage message)`. Its purpose is to provide a contract for classes that need to process incoming messages in the BigBlueButton conferencing system. Implementers of this interface will define how specific message types are handled when received. The interface serves as a callback mechanism for message processing within the system's messaging infrastructure. (58 words)
