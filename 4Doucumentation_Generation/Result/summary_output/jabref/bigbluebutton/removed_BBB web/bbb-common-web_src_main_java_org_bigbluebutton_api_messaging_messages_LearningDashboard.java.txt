The `LearningDashboard` class is a message container that holds data for a learning dashboard in a meeting system. It stores three pieces of information: `meetingId` (identifies the meeting), `activityJson` (contains dashboard activity data in JSON format), and `learningDashboardAccessToken` (provides access authentication). The class implements `IMessage`, indicating it's used for messaging purposes. The constructor initializes these three fields when creating a `LearningDashboard` instance. (98 words)
