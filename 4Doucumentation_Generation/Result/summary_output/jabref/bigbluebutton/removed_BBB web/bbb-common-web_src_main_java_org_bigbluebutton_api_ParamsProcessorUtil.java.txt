The `ParamsProcessorUtil` class is a utility class for processing meeting parameters in the BigBlueButton API. Its main functionality includes:

1. Validating and processing meeting creation parameters (IDs, passwords, voice bridges, etc.)
2. Generating default values for missing parameters
3. Handling metadata and custom data for meetings
4. Processing security checksums for API requests
5. Managing meeting settings like recording, duration, webcam permissions, and layout
6. Supporting breakout rooms with specific configurations
7. Applying lock settings for meetings (disabling cams, mics, chat, etc.)
8. Converting between external and internal meeting IDs
9. Processing user groups and custom data

The class serves as a central processor for meeting-related parameters, ensuring they meet system requirements before being used to create or modify meetings.
