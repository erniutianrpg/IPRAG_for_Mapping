The `RecordProp2` class is a simple Java data container that holds three boolean properties related to recording settings: whether recording is enabled (`record`), whether recording should start automatically (`autoStartRecording`), and whether manual start/stop of recording is allowed (`allowStartStopRecording`). It provides a constructor to initialize these immutable properties.
