The `Metadata` class stores key-value pairs in a `TreeMap` and provides methods to manage them. It uses Jackson annotations (`@JsonAnyGetter` and `@JsonAnySetter`) to serialize/deserialize the map to/from XML/JSON. Key functionalities include adding (`set`), removing (`remove`), and checking for keys (`containsKey`), with the map accessible via `get()`. The class is annotated to serialize as an XML root element named "meta". (98 words)
