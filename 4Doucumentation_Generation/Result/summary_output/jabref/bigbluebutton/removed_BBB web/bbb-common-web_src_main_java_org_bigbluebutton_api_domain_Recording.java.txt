This code defines a `Recording` class in the BigBlueButton API that represents a meeting recording. It stores recording details like ID, meeting ID, name, timestamps, participant count, size, playback formats, and metadata. The class provides getters/setters for these properties and handles date format conversion from legacy to timestamp format. It also manages recording states (published, processed, deleted etc.) and playback information, including multiple formats and extensions. Metadata is stored in a key-value map for additional recording attributes.
