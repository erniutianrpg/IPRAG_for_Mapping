The `IBbbWebApiGWApp` interface defines methods for managing BigBlueButton meetings and recordings. It handles meeting creation with various parameters (security, recording, layout, etc.), user registration, meeting destruction/ending, and recording lifecycle events (publish/unpublish/delete). It also includes utility methods like sending keep-alive messages and document conversion notifications. The interface serves as a gateway for BigBlueButton's web API to interact with its core functionality.
