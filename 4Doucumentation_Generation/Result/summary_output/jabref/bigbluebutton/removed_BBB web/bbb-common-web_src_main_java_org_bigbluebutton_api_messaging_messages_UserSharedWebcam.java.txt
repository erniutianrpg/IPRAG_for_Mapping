The `UserSharedWebcam` class is a message model representing a user sharing their webcam in a meeting. It contains three fields: `meetingId` (identifies the meeting), `userId` (identifies the user), and `stream` (webcam stream data). The class implements `IMessage` and initializes these fields via its constructor. This is likely used in a messaging system to notify about webcam sharing events. (60 words)
