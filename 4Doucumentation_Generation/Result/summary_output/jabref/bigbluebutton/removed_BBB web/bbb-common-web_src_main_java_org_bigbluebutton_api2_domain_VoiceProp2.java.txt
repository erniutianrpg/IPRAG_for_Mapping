The `VoiceProp2` class is a simple Java data container that holds three voice-related properties: `telVoice` (telephone voice), `webVoice` (web voice), and `dialNumber` (dial-in number). It provides a constructor to initialize these immutable (final) fields, making it a basic value object for voice configuration data.
