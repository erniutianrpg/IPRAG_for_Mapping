This code is a validator that checks if a user session token is valid. It implements `ConstraintValidator` to verify that the provided session token is not null and corresponds to an existing user session in the system. If the token is null or no session is found, it returns false; otherwise, it returns true. The validator is tied to the `UserSessionConstraint` annotation.
