This code defines an `AbstractCommandHandler` class that extends `NuAbstractProcessHandler` to handle process execution. It captures and stores process output (stdout/stderr) in StringBuilders, tracks the exit code, and provides utility methods to check for errors (non-zero exit code), command success, timeouts (exit code 124), and output content. It serves as a base class for executing and monitoring external commands.
