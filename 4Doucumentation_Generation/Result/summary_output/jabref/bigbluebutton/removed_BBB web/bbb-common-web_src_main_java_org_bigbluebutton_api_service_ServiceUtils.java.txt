This utility class provides helper methods for meeting-related operations in a BigBlueButton API service. It maintains references to `MeetingService` and `ValidationService`, and offers a static method `findMeetingFromMeetingID()` to locate meetings by ID. If the meeting isn't found directly, it attempts to convert the provided ID to an internal format and retries the search. The class logs each step of the meeting lookup process. Essentially, it acts as a bridge between meeting identifiers and the meeting service, handling ID conversions when necessary.
