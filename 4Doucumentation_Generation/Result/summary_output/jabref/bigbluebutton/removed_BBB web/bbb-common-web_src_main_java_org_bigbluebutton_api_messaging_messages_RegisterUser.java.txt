The `RegisterUser` class is a message object that encapsulates user registration data for a meeting. It stores details like meeting ID, user identifiers, name, role, authentication tokens, avatar URL, guest status, and various flags (e.g., whether the user is excluded from the dashboard or left the guest lobby). This class implements `IMessage`, indicating it's used for messaging within a larger system (likely BigBlueButton's API). It's essentially a data container with a constructor that initializes all user-related fields.
