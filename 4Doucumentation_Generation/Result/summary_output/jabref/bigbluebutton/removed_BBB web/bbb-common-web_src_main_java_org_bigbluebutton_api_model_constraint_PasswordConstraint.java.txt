This code defines a custom annotation `@PasswordConstraint` for password validation in Java. It specifies that the annotation should be processed by `PasswordValidator` at runtime and can be applied to fields. The annotation includes default values for a message key ("invalidPassword"), error message ("Invalid password"), and empty arrays for validation groups and payload. Essentially, it enables custom password validation logic when applied to fields.
