The code defines a custom annotation `@SizeList` that can be applied to methods, fields, parameters, and other types. It stores an array of `@Size` annotations and is retained at runtime. This annotation is likely used for validation purposes, allowing multiple `@Size` constraints to be specified together on a single element.
