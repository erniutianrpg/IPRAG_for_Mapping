This Java application handles importing and exporting recording metadata for BigBlueButton (a web conferencing system). It offers two modes: command-line (with flags for export/import, persistence, and recording IDs) and interactive (menu-driven). The app creates default directories if needed and delegates operations to `RecordingImportHandler` and `RecordingExportHandler` classes. Key features include bulk/single recording processing and persistence options for imports.
