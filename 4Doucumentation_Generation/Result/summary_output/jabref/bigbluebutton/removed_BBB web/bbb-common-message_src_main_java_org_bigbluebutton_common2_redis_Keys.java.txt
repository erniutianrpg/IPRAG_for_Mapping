This code defines a Java class `Keys` that stores constant string values used as Redis key prefixes for a BigBlueButton conferencing system. The keys are used to identify meetings (`MEETING`), track active meetings (`MEETINGS`), store meeting info (`MEETING_INFO`), and manage breakout rooms (`BREAKOUT_MEETING`, `BREAKOUT_ROOMS`). These constants help organize and access Redis data structures for meeting-related operations. (98 words)
