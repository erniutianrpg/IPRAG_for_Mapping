This code defines a custom Java annotation `@MeetingEndedConstraint` for validation purposes. It checks if a meeting has been forcibly ended before allowing a join operation. The annotation is processed by `MeetingEndedValidator` and can be applied to fields. It includes default error messages and configurations for validation groups and payloads, following Java's Bean Validation API standards.
