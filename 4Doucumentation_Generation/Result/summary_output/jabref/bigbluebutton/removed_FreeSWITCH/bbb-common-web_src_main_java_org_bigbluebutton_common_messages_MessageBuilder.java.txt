This Java code provides utility methods for constructing messages in JSON format. It defines constants for message components (version, name, header, payload, etc.) and includes methods to: 1) generate timestamps in milliseconds, 2) build message headers with name, version, timestamp, and optional reply-to field, and 3) construct a complete JSON message by combining header and payload using Google's Gson library. The code serves as a helper for creating standardized message structures.
