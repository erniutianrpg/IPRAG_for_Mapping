The `BreakoutRoomsParams` class is a simple data container that holds configuration parameters for breakout rooms in a BigBlueButton meeting. It stores boolean flags for recording, private chat, note capture, and slide capture, along with filenames for captured notes and slides. The class uses a constructor to initialize these immutable fields.
