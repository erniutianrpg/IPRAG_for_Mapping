The code defines a `UserLockedInMeeting` message class that implements `IMessage`. It contains three immutable fields: `meetingId`, `userId`, and `locked`, which respectively store the meeting ID, user ID, and a boolean indicating if the user is locked in the meeting. The constructor initializes these fields. This class is used to communicate user lock status changes within a meeting. (60 words)
