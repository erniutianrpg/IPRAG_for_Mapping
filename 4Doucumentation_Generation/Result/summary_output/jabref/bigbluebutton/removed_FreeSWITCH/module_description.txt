This module provides core messaging, recording management, and presentation validation services for BigBlueButton, a web conferencing system. It handles standardized message construction and communication between components, including heartbeat monitoring and user status updates. The module manages recording lifecycle operations (import/export of metadata and playback information) and validates presentation files for compatibility. Additionally, it implements Redis-based storage for meeting data and breakout room configurations, supporting distributed system operations through structured message passing and persistent data management.
