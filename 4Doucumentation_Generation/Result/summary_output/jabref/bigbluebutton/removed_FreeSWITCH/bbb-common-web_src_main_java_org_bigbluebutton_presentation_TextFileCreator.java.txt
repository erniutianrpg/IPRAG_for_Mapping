This code defines a Java interface `TextFileCreator` for the BigBlueButton presentation system. The interface declares a single method `createTextFile` that takes an `UploadedPresentation` object and a page number as parameters, returning a boolean to indicate success. Its purpose is to abstract the creation of text files from presentations, likely for extracting or converting text content from specific slides. The implementation details are left to concrete classes. (94 words)
