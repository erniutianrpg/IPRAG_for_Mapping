The code defines a `UserSharedWebcam` class that implements the `IMessage` interface, representing a message about a user sharing their webcam in a meeting. It stores three pieces of data: `meetingId` (the meeting identifier), `userId` (the user identifier), and `stream` (the webcam stream details). The constructor initializes these fields when creating an instance of the message.
