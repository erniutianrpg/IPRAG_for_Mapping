The `KeepAlivePong` class is a simple data structure representing a keep-alive response message. It stores three pieces of information: the system name, a timestamp from the web component (bbbWebTimestamp), and a timestamp from the Akka apps component (akkaAppsTimestamp). This class acts as a container for these values, which are set via its constructor and cannot be modified afterward (immutable). It's likely used in a heartbeat/keep-alive mechanism to monitor system liveness.
