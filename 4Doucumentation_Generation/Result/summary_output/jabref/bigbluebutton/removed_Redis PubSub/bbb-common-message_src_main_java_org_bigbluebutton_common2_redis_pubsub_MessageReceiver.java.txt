This code implements a Redis pub/sub message receiver in Java. It connects to a Redis server, subscribes to a specific channel pattern (`from-akka-apps-redis-channel`), and listens for incoming messages. When messages are received, they're processed by a `ReceivedMessageHandler` in a separate thread. The connection is managed with connection pooling and includes auto-reconnect functionality. The class provides `start()` and `stop()` methods to control the message receiving process, and handles subscription/unsubscription events with logging.
