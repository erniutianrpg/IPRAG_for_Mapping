This code provides an abstract base class `RedisAwareCommunicator` for Redis communication in BigBlueButton. It handles Redis connection events (connected, activated, deactivated, disconnected) with logging, manages connection settings (host, port, password), and includes a pool configuration setup. Subclasses must implement `start()` and `stop()` methods for specific Redis operations. The class uses Lettuce as the Redis client and supports connection pooling with predefined settings.
