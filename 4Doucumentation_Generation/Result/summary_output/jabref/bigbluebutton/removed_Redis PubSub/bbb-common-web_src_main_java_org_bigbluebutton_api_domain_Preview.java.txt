The code defines a `Preview` class in Java that represents a collection of images. It uses Jackson XML annotations (`@JacksonXmlElementWrapper` and `@JacksonXmlProperty`) to specify XML serialization formatting, where images are wrapped in an `<images>` element with each image as an `<image>` child. The class provides getter and setter methods for accessing and modifying the `Image` array. In short, it's a simple POJO for handling image previews with XML serialization support. (94 words)
