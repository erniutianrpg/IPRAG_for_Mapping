The `GuestsStatus` class is a simple Java data structure that represents a guest user's status in a meeting. It contains two immutable fields: `userId` (identifying the guest) and `status` (representing their current status). The class provides a constructor to initialize these values. This is likely used in a messaging system to track and communicate guest status changes. (58 words)
