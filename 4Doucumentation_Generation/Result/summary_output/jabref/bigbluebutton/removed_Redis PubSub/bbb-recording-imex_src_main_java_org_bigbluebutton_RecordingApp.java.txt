This Java application handles importing and exporting recording metadata for BigBlueButton. It offers two modes: 
1) **Command-line mode** for batch processing with options to import/export single or multiple recordings, and 
2) **Interactive mode** for step-by-step user guidance. The app supports persistence flags for imports and creates default directories if none is specified. Key operations are delegated to `RecordingImportHandler` and `RecordingExportHandler` classes.
