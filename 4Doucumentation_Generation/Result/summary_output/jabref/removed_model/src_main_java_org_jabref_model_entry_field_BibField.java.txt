The `BibField` class is a Java record that represents a bibliographic field with a name (`Field`) and priority (`FieldPriority`). It overrides `equals()` and `hashCode()` to compare fields case-insensitively by name, implements `Comparable` to enable sorting by field name, and provides a readable `toString()` representation. The class ensures field names are the primary comparison attribute for equality, sorting, and hashing. (98 words)
