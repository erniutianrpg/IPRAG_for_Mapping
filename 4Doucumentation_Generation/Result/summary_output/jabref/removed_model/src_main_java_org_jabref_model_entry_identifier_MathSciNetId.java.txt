The `MathSciNetId` class represents an article identifier for MathSciNet (MRNumber). It stores the identifier string, provides parsing from raw input (handling formats like "619693 (82j:58046)"), and implements standard methods like equality checks, hashing, and string conversion. It can generate a URL to access the article in MathSciNet's online database and returns the default bibliographic field (`MR_NUMBER`) for this identifier type. The normalized form is the identifier itself.
