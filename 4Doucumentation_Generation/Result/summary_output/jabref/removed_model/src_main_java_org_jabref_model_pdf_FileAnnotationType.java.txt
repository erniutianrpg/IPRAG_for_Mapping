This code defines an enum `FileAnnotationType` representing different PDF annotation types (like Highlight, Underline, etc.). It provides methods to: 
1. Parse a PDF annotation (`PDAnnotation`) into its corresponding enum type (defaulting to `UNKNOWN` if unsupported). 
2. Check if a given annotation type is a "marked" type (e.g., Highlight, Underline) that requires special handling. 
3. Determine if an enum type is a linked annotation. 
The enum tracks each type's name and whether itâ€™s a linked annotation (requiring special processing). Unsupported types are logged and treated as `UNKNOWN`. (99 words)
