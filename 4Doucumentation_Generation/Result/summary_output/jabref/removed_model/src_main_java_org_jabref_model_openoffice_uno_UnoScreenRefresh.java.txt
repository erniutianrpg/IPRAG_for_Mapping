This Java class `UnoScreenRefresh` provides static methods to control screen refresh in OpenOffice documents. It uses the `XTextDocument` interface to `lockControllers()` (disable screen updates), `unlockControllers()` (re-enable updates), and `check hasControllersLocked()` (verify lock status). These methods help optimize performance by preventing unnecessary screen refreshes during batch operations. The class cannot be instantiated (private constructor).
