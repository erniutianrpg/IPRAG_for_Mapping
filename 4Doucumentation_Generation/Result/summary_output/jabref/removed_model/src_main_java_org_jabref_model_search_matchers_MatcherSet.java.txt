The `MatcherSet` class is an abstract base class that manages a set of `SearchMatcher` rules. It provides functionality to add new matchers (`addRule`), check equality based on contained matchers (`equals`), generate hash codes (`hashCode`), and produce a string representation (`toString`). The class maintains the matchers in a list and ensures added rules are non-null. Concrete implementations would define how these matchers are combined for searching. (98 words)
