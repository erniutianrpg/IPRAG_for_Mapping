This code defines an abstract class `DatabaseChangeResolver` (with a single permitted subclass `EntryChangeResolver`) that serves as a base for resolving database changes in JabRef. It requires a `DialogService` for user interaction and declares an abstract method `askUserToResolveChange()` that returns an `Optional<DatabaseChange>`, allowing subclasses to implement specific change resolution logic through user dialogs. The class is designed to be extended for different types of database change resolutions. (98 words)
