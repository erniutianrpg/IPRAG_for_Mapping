The `ContentSelector` class represents a field with predefined values in JabRef. It stores a `Field` and a list of `String` values, providing constructors for array or list inputs. Key functionalities include: field and values retrieval via getters (with values returned as unmodifiable list), and standard `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` implementations for object comparison and representation. The class ensures immutability of the values list once constructed.
