This code implements a generic tree node structure (`TreeNode<T>`) that provides core tree functionality through inheritance. Key features include: managing parent-child relationships, adding/removing/moving nodes, traversing paths, checking ancestry, sorting children, and notifying subscribers of tree changes. The class is abstract, requiring concrete implementations to handle node copying. It supports observable children lists and enables tree operations like finding descendants matching predicates or copying subtrees. The design ensures type safety through generics while providing comprehensive tree manipulation capabilities.
