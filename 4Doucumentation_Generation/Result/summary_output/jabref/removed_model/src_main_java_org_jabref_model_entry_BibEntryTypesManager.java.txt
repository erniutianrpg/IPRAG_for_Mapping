The `BibEntryTypesManager` class manages BibTeX and BibLaTeX entry types, handling standard and custom/modified types. It provides methods to:
- Retrieve all custom types for a database mode
- Check if a type is custom/modified
- Add, remove, or clear custom/modified types
- Enrich entry types with additional information
- Compare types for differences

The class internally separates standard types (BibTeX/BibLaTeX) and custom types, offering operations to manipulate and query them based on the database mode (BibTeX or BibLaTeX).
