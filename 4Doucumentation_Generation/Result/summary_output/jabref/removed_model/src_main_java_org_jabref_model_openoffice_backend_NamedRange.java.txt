The `NamedRange` interface provides methods to manage named text ranges (like reference marks or bookmarks) in LibreOffice/OpenOffice documents. It allows retrieving, modifying, and removing these ranges, with operations to get their positions (`getMarkRange`), obtain cursors for editing (`getRawCursor`, `getFillCursor`), clean up after editing (`cleanFillCursor`), and delete them (`removeFromDocument`). It handles document exceptions and supports optional results when marks are missing. Currently, only reference mark implementation is provided.
