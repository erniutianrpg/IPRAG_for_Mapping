The `ApplicationInsightsWriter` class is a custom log writer for JabRef that sends log entries to Microsoft Application Insights. It processes log entries, converts them into either `ExceptionTelemetry` (for exceptions) or `TraceTelemetry` (for regular messages), sets severity levels, adds custom parameters, and transmits them via the global telemetry client. It implements required methods for a log writer but has empty `flush()` and `close()` methods.
