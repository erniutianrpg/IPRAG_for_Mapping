The `MsBibAuthor` class processes author information for MS BibTeX format. It takes an `Author` object, splits the first name into first and middle names, and stores corporate author status. It provides methods to retrieve the author's first, middle, and last names in different formats (e.g., "First Last" or "Last, First") and checks if the author is corporate. The class acts as an adapter between JabRef's `Author` model and MS BibTeX's author format.
