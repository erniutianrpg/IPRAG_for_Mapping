The `DatabaseChangeDetailsViewFactory` class creates appropriate view components for different types of database changes in a bibliography manager (JabRef). Based on the type of change (e.g., entry addition, deletion, modification, string operations, metadata/group changes), it instantiates and returns a corresponding details view component. This factory centralizes the logic for generating change-specific UIs, using injected dependencies like database context, preferences, and theme management.
