The `SharedBibEntryData` class manages entry data for a shared SQL database in JabRef. It tracks a unique `sharedID` (assigned by the database) and a `version` for synchronization. The class provides getters/setters for these fields, a `toString()` method for debugging, and a `compareTo()` method that orders entries first by `sharedID` and then by `version`. Default values are `sharedID = -1` and `version = 1`. This facilitates version control and synchronization across multiple JabRef instances.
