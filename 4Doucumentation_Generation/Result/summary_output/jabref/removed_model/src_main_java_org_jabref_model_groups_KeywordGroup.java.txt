The `KeywordGroup` class is an abstract group implementation that matches bibliographic entries based on a search phrase in a specified field. It stores the search field, expression, and case sensitivity flag, providing getters for these properties. The class overrides `equals()` and `hashCode()` for proper comparison and implements `isDynamic()` to indicate dynamic grouping behavior. It inherits from `AbstractGroup` for basic group functionality.
