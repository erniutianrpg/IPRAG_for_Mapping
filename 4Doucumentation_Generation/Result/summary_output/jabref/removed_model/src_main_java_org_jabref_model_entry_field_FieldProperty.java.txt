This Java enum `FieldProperty` defines various properties that can be associated with bibliographic fields in JabRef, such as book names, dates, DOIs, editor types, and more. These properties categorize fields by their content type (e.g., numeric, multiline text) or behavior (e.g., entry links, verbatim values), helping to validate and process bibliographic data appropriately.
