This code is a benchmarking suite for JabRef, a reference management software. It tests various operations including:
1. Parsing and writing BibTeX entries
2. Searching entries (both sequential and parallel)
3. Converting between LaTeX, Unicode, and HTML formats
4. Detecting BibTeX database modes
5. Checking keyword group membership
The benchmarks use JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness) to measure performance with 1000 sample entries. Each `@Benchmark` method tests a specific functionality.
