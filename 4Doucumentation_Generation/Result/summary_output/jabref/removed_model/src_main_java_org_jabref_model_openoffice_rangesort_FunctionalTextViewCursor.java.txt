This code provides a `FunctionalTextViewCursor` class to handle and ensure the functionality of a LibreOffice/OpenOffice text view cursor (`XTextViewCursor`). It addresses cases where the cursor might be in an invalid state (e.g., inside a frame, image, or comment) by attempting to reposition it to a valid text range. The class stores the cursor's initial state and provides methods to restore it. If the cursor cannot be made functional, it returns an error message. The main use case is ensuring reliable cursor operations in a LibreOffice/OpenOffice document.
