The `BibDatabaseContext` class manages a BibTeX database, including its entries, metadata, file paths, and synchronization with shared databases. It handles database modes (BibLaTeX/BibTeX), file directories, and full-text index paths. The class provides methods to convert between local and shared databases, retrieve file directories based on preferences, and check for empty entries. It also manages database location (local/shared) and synchronization with a DBMS.
