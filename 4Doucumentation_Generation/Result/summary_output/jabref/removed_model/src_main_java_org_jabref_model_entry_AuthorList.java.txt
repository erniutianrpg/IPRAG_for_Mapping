The `AuthorList` class parses and manages author/editor names in BibTeX format. It provides methods to format author lists in various styles (e.g., "Last, First", "First Last", last names only), with options for abbreviation and Oxford commas. The class handles name parsing according to BibTeX conventions, supports caching for performance, and offers utilities for alphabetization. Key features include immutable author objects, LaTeX-free versions, and multiple output formats (natbib-style, last-first, first-last). The parsing logic handles complex cases like name particles ("von"), junior suffixes, and special characters while maintaining BibTeX compatibility.
