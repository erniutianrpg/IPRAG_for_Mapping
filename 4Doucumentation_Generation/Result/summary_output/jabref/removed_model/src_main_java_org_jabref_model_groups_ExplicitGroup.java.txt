The `ExplicitGroup` class represents a static group of bibliography entries manually assigned via the `GROUPS` field. It extends `WordKeywordGroup` to handle group membership and maintains legacy entry keys from older JabRef versions. Key functionalities include adding/clearing legacy keys, deep copying, equality checks, and indicating it's not a dynamic group. The class ensures immutability of legacy keys and proper object comparison via `equals()` and `hashCode()`.
