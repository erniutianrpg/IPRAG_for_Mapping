The `ChainNode<T>` class provides a base implementation for creating and managing a chain (linked list) of nodes in a hierarchical structure. Each node can have one parent and one child. Key functionalities include: getting/setting parent/child nodes, moving nodes within the chain, removing children, checking ancestor-descendant relationships, and appending nodes to the end of the chain. The class uses generics to ensure type safety and requires extending classes to properly implement the chain structure.
