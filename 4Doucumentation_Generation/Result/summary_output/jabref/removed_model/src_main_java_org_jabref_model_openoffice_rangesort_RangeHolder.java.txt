The provided Java interface `RangeHolder` defines a single method `getRange()` that returns an `XTextRange` object from the OpenOffice UNO API. This interface serves as a simple contract for classes that need to provide access to a text range within an OpenOffice document, allowing other components to retrieve the range's location or content. The functionality is minimal, focusing solely on range retrieval.
