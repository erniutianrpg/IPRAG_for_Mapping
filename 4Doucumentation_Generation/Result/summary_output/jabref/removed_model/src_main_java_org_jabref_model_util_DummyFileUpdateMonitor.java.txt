The `DummyFileUpdateMonitor` is a no-operation implementation of the `FileUpdateMonitor` interface. It ignores file update events by providing empty method implementations for adding/removing file listeners, always returns `false` for `isActive()`, and performs no action on `shutdown()`. This class is used when file updates don't need to be monitored.
