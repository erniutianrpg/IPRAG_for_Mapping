The `ParsedEntryLink` class manages links between bibliography entries in a BibTeX database. It stores a citation key (`key`), an optional linked `BibEntry`, and a reference to the `BibDatabase`. It provides constructors to create links either by key (looking up the entry in the database) or directly from an entry. Methods include getting/setting the key, retrieving the linked entry/database, and overriding `equals`/`hashCode` for comparison. The class ensures synchronization between the key and linked entry when the key changes. (98 words)
