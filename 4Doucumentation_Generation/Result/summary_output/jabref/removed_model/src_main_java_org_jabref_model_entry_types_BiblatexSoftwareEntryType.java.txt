This code defines an enum `BiblatexSoftwareEntryType` that represents different BibLaTeX entry types for software-related references (Dataset, SoftwareVersion, SoftwareModule, CodeFragment). Each enum value has a display name and provides methods to get its name (lowercase) and display name. The `fromName` method allows case-insensitive lookup of enum values by name, returning an `Optional` result. This enum implements the `EntryType` interface, standardizing how these reference types are handled.
