The code defines a utility class `MatcherSets` that creates and returns different types of matcher sets (`AndMatcher` or `OrMatcher`) based on the specified `MatcherType` (AND or OR). This acts as a simple factory pattern for constructing matcher objects used in search operations. The `build` method returns an `AndMatcher` for `MatcherType.AND` and an `OrMatcher` for `MatcherType.OR`.
