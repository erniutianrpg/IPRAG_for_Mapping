The code defines a functional interface `SearchMatcher` with a single abstract method `isMatch` that takes a `BibEntry` object and returns a boolean. This interface is designed to check if a given bibliographic entry matches certain search criteria, serving as a predicate for filtering or searching entries. Being a functional interface, it can be implemented using lambda expressions or method references.
