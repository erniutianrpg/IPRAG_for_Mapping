This code provides utility methods for handling entry links in a BibTeX database. The `parse` method splits a comma-separated string into individual entry keys and creates `ParsedEntryLink` objects for each, associating them with a database. The `serialize` method does the reverse, joining a list of `ParsedEntryLink` objects into a comma-separated string of keys. Essentially, it facilitates conversion between string-based and object-based representations of bibliographic entry links.
