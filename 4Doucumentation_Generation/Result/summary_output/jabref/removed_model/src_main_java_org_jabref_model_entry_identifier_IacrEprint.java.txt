The `IacrEprint` class represents an IACR (International Association for Cryptologic Research) eprint identifier. It validates and normalizes IACR eprint IDs (format: YYYY/NNNN), provides methods to parse them from strings, and generates their normalized form and external URIs (e.g., `https://ia.cr/YYYY/NNNN`). The default field for this identifier is `EPRINT`. Invalid IDs throw an `IllegalArgumentException`.
