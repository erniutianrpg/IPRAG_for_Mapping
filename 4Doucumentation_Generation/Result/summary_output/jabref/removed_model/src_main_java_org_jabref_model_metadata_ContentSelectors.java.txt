The `ContentSelectors` class manages a collection of `ContentSelector` objects, which associate fields with predefined values. Key functionalities include: adding/removing selectors, parsing semicolon-separated values into selectors, retrieving values for specific fields, getting all selectors or fields with selectors, and standard `equals()`/`hashCode()` methods. The class maintains an immutable list of selectors and provides utility methods for selector management.
