The `StudyQuery` class represents a simple container for a search query string. It provides basic functionality including:
- Constructors (one with a query parameter, one empty for deserialization)
- Getter and setter for the query string
- `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods that compare queries
- A `toString()` method for string representation

The class is primarily a data holder that ensures proper query comparison and serialization support. (98 words)
