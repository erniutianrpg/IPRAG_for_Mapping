The `FieldChange` class tracks modifications to fields in a `BibEntry`, storing the entry, field, old value, and new value. It provides getters for these attributes and overrides `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` for proper comparison and string representation. This class is used to log changes when a field is added, modified, or removed in a bibliography entry. (98 words)
