The `@AllowedToUseAwt` annotation is a marker interface indicating that a specific logic class is permitted to access AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) components. It includes a mandatory `value()` field to provide the rationale or justification for why AWT access is allowed for that class. This helps enforce architectural constraints by explicitly documenting exceptions where AWT usage is permitted.
