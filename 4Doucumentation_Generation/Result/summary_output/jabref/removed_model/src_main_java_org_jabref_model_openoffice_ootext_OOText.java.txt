The `OOText` class represents text with HTML-like markup for OpenOffice integration. It wraps a `String` and provides static methods to convert between `String` and `OOText` (handling null values). The class includes standard `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` methods, comparing or returning the underlying string data. Essentially, it's a simple immutable wrapper for formatted text strings with null-safe conversions. (98 words)
