The `RangeOverlap` class is a simple data structure used to report overlapping ranges. It stores the type of overlap (`RangeOverlapKind`) and a list of values associated with the overlapping ranges. The class is generic (`<V>`) to support different value types, and its fields are immutable (`final`). It serves as a container for overlap information in range-sorting operations. (60 words)
