The `BstNameFormatter` class formats author names according to BibTeX's `format.name$` function rules. It takes an author list string, an index (starting at 1), and a format string to specify how to format the selected name (e.g., initials, last name). The main method `formatName` parses the author list, selects the specified author, and applies complex formatting based on the format string's directives (like 'f' for first name, 'l' for last name). It handles special cases like abbreviations, hyphenated names, and brace matching, while logging warnings for invalid formats or indices.
