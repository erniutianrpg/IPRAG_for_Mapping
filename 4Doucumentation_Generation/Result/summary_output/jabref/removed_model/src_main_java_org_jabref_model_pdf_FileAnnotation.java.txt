This code defines a `FileAnnotation` class that represents PDF annotations with properties like author, modification time, page number, content, and type. It provides constructors to create annotations from PDF objects (`PDAnnotation`) and supports linked annotations (e.g., sticky notes). The class includes methods to parse dates, clean content, abbreviate long names, and check equality. It also offers getters for annotation properties and handles linked annotations via `Optional`. The class ensures proper string representation and supports logging for date parsing errors.
