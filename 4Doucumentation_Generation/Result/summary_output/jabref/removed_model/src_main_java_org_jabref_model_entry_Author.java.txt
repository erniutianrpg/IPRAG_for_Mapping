The `Author` class represents an immutable container for author information in BibTeX entries. It stores and processes name parts (first, abbreviated first, von, last, and junior) with methods to format them in different styles (e.g., "Last, First" or "First Last"). It handles LaTeX encoding (e.g., braces, accents) and abbreviations, ensuring proper formatting for bibliographic use. Key methods include `getLastFirst`, `getFirstLast`, and `latexFree` for LaTeX-free output. The class also includes utilities for name normalization and comparison.
