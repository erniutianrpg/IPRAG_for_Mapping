This code migrates legacy explicit groups in JabRef, where entries were marked with group assignments (e.g., `[Nicolas:6]`), to a modern format where groups contain their entries. It scans entries for markings, creates corresponding explicit groups, assigns entries to these groups, and removes the old markings. The migration preserves existing group structures while adding the converted groups under a new "Markings" root group.
