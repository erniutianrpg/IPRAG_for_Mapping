The `StandardField` enum defines standard BibTeX and BibLaTeX fields along with JabRef-specific fields used in bibliography entries. Each field has a name, optional display name, and properties (like `PERSON_NAMES`, `DATE`, etc.) that describe its characteristics. The enum provides methods to get field properties, names, and display names, and includes a utility method (`fromName`) to look up fields by name. This serves as a centralized definition of supported fields and their metadata in JabRef. (98 words)
