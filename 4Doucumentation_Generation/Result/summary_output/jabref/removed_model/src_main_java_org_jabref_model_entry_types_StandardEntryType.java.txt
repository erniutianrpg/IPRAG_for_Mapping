This code defines an enum `StandardEntryType` that implements `EntryType`, representing standard BibTeX and BibLaTeX bibliographic entry types (e.g., Article, Book, Thesis). Each enum constant has a display name, and the class provides methods to retrieve the name in lowercase (`getName()`) and the original display name (`getDisplayName()`). It serves as a centralized definition of supported entry types for bibliographic references.
