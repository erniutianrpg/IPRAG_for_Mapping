The `LatexToUnicodeAdapter` class converts LaTeX-formatted strings to Unicode. It handles underscores specially by temporarily replacing them with a placeholder character (`\uFFFD`) to avoid parsing issues. The main method `format()` returns the converted string or the original if conversion fails, while `parse()` returns an `Optional` with the converted string or empty on failure. The converted text is normalized to NFC form. This class serves as an alternative to JabRef's existing LaTeX-to-Unicode converter.
