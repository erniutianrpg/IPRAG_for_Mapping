The `MultiKeyMap` class is a two-level map that stores values using an enum key (`K1`) and a secondary key (`K2`). It provides methods to:  
- **Get** a value via both keys (returning `Optional<V>`),  
- **Put** a value using both keys (creating nested maps if needed), and  
- **Remove** all entries for a given enum key (`K1`).  
It uses an `EnumMap` for the primary key and `HashMap` for secondary keys, ensuring efficient enum-based lookups.
