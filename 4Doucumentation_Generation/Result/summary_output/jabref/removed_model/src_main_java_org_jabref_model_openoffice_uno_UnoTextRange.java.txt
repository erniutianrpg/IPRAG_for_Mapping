This code provides utility methods for working with text ranges in OpenOffice/LibreOffice documents. Key functionalities include: 
1. Retrieving a footnote marker range if the given text range is within a footnote (`getFootnoteMarkRange`).
2. Comparing text ranges by their start/end positions (`compareStarts`, `compareEnds`, `compareStartsThenEnds`), with checks to ensure ranges are comparable (from the same text). 
3. All comparisons follow Java conventions (returning 1, -1, or 0). The methods throw exceptions for incomparable ranges.
