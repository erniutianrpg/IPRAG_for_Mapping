This code defines an enum `IEEETranEntryType` that implements an `EntryType` interface, representing different entry types for IEEEtran bibliography styles. It includes five entry types (e.g., `Patent`, `Standard`) with display names. The class provides methods to get the lowercase name (`getName()`) and display name (`getDisplayName()`), and a static method `fromName()` to find an enum value by case-insensitive name matching. The functionality centers around managing and retrieving IEEEtran-specific entry types. (98 words)
