This code defines a custom annotation `@ApacheCommonsLang3Allowed` used to mark cases where Apache Commons Lang3 usage is permitted in a codebase that primarily prefers Google Guava. The annotation includes a required `value()` field to document the rationale for this exception. Its purpose is to enforce and track justified usage of Apache Commons Lang3 when no Guava alternative exists. (58 words)
