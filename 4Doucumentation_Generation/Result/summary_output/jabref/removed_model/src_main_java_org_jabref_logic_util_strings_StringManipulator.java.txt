This code provides string manipulation utilities for text editing operations. It can:
1. Change word casing (uppercase, lowercase, capitalize) from a given cursor position
2. Delete words forward or backward from the cursor position
3. Find word boundaries in either direction
The main operations preserve whitespace and return both the modified string and updated cursor position in a `ResultingStringState` object. It's designed for text editor functionality like word-based editing and case changes.
