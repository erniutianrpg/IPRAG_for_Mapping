This code defines an `ApplicationInsightsLogEvent` class that adapts a tinylog `LogEntry` to Microsoft Application Insights' logging format. It extracts and converts log data including message, exception details, severity level, and contextual metadata (thread name, timestamp, stack trace) into a format compatible with Application Insights telemetry. The class maps tinylog severity levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, etc.) to Application Insights' severity levels and packages all log information into custom parameters for telemetry reporting.
