This code defines an `ISSN` class for handling International Standard Serial Numbers (ISSN). It provides methods to:
1. Validate the ISSN format (with or without a dash)
2. Clean malformed ISSNs by adding a dash
3. Verify the checksum digit for correctness
The class uses regex patterns to check the format (e.g., "1234-567X") and implements the standard ISSN checksum validation algorithm.
