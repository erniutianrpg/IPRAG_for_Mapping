The `SearchResult` class processes and stores PDF search results using Lucene. It extracts metadata (path, page number, modification time) and highlights matching content/annotations in HTML format. The class provides methods to access these results and check if they match a given `BibEntry`. Key features include Lucene score tracking, text highlighting with stemming, and HTML formatting of matches.
