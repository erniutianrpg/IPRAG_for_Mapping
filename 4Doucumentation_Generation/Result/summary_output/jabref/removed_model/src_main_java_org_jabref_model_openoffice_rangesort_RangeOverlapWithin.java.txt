This code identifies overlapping or touching text ranges within a document. It takes a list of `RangeHolder` objects, partitions and sorts them, then checks for three types of overlaps: identical ranges, overlapping ranges, and touching ranges (if specified). The results are limited by `reportAtMost`. The comparison is done using UNO (Universal Network Objects) API for text range operations in OpenOffice/LibreOffice documents. The output is a list of `RangeOverlap` objects indicating the type and locations of overlaps found.
