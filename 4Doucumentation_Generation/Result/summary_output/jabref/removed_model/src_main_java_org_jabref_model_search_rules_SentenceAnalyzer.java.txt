The `SentenceAnalyzer` class splits a search query string into words, handling escaped characters (`\`) and quoted phrases (`"`). It processes each character, tracking escape sequences and quoted sections, and splits words at whitespace (unless within quotes). Quoted phrases are treated as single words. The result is a list of parsed words, preserving escaped characters and quoted content. For example, `hello "world of code"` would split into `["hello", "world of code"]`.
