This code defines an `InternalField` enum in JabRef that represents special-purpose fields used internally, not standard BibTeX fields. It includes fields like citation keys, entry types, markers for BibTeX strings, and internal identifiers. Each field has a name and optional properties. The class provides methods to get field properties, check if it's a standard field, and look up fields by name (with backward compatibility for "bibtexkey"). These fields are used for internal processing and metadata serialization in JabRef.
