The `SpecialFieldViewModel` class manages special fields (like priority, read status, etc.) in BibTeX entries for the JabRef reference manager. It provides methods to: 
- Get field properties (icon, localization, values)
- Create actions for modifying field values
- Update field values in entries with undo support
- Toggle field values for single-value fields

The class acts as a bridge between the UI and the underlying data model, handling special field operations while maintaining undo functionality.
