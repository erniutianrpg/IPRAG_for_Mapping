This code defines an enum `BiblatexApaEntryType` that implements an `EntryType` interface, representing different bibliographic entry types for APA-style references in BibLaTeX. It includes five entry types (Legislation, Legadminmaterial, Jurisdiction, Constitution, Legal) with display names. The class provides methods to get the lowercase name (`getName()`), the display name (`getDisplayName()`), and a static method `fromName()` to find an enum value by name (case-insensitive). The functionality centers around managing and retrieving these specific entry types.
