This code provides a frontend interface for managing citations in an OpenOffice/LibreOffice document through JabRef. It handles:

1. Reading and writing citation groups from/to the document
2. Sorting citations visually or within document partitions
3. Checking for overlapping citation ranges
4. Creating, removing, and modifying citations
5. Managing citation entries and their display order
6. Handling footnotes and bibliography marks

The class acts as a bridge between the OpenOffice API and JabRef's backend logic, providing document operations while maintaining citation group state.
