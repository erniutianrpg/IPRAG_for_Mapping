The `OOTuple3` class is a simple generic container that holds three objects of different types (`A`, `B`, `C`). It provides immutable fields (`a`, `b`, `c`) to access these objects and is useful for passing or grouping three related values without creating a dedicated class. This avoids the need for a custom class or a `Trifunction` when bundling three objects together.
