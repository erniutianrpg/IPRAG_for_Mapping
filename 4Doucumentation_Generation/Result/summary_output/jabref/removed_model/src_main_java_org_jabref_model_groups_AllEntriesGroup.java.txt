The `AllEntriesGroup` class represents a group that contains all BibTeX entries unconditionally. It inherits from `AbstractGroup` and overrides methods to always return `true` for `contains()` (indicating any entry belongs to this group), `false` for `isDynamic()`, and implements equality checks based on the group name. The class also provides deep copy functionality and proper hash code generation. Essentially, it's a static group that includes every entry in a bibliography database.
