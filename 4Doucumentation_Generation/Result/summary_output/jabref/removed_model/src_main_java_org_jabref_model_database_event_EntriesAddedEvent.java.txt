The `EntriesAddedEvent` class represents an event triggered when one or more `BibEntry` items are added to a `BibDatabase`. It extends `EntriesEvent` and includes optional metadata about the first entry added. The class provides two constructors: one that accepts a list of entries and their source location, and another that also tracks the first entry. A getter method retrieves the first entry. This event is used to notify listeners about database additions. (98 words)
