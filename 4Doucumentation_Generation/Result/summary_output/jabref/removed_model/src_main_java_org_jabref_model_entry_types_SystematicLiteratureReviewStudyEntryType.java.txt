This code defines an enum `SystematicLiteratureReviewStudyEntryType` that represents three entry types for systematic literature reviews: Study, SearchQuery, and Library. Each type has a display name and provides methods to get its name (lowercase) and display name. The `fromName` method allows looking up an enum value by name (case-insensitive). Essentially, it's a type-safe way to handle different entry types in a systematic literature review system. (98 words)
