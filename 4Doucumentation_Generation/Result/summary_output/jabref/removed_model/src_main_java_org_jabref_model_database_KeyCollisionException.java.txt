The `KeyCollisionException` class is a custom runtime exception in Java that signals a key collision error, typically in a database context. It extends `RuntimeException` and provides four constructors for different error scenarios, including messages, causes, and a specific ID. The `getId()` method allows retrieval of the associated ID. This exception is used to handle cases where duplicate or conflicting keys are encountered. (98 words)
