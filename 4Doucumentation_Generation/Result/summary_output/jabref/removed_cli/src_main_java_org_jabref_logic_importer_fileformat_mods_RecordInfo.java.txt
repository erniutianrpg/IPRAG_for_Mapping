This Java record `RecordInfo` represents metadata about a record, containing two lists: `recordContents` for record details and `languages` for language information. It includes a static set `elementNameSet` defining valid record element names (e.g., "recordContentSource", "recordCreationDate"). The default constructor initializes empty lists for both fields. The record is part of a MODS (Metadata Object Description Schema) importer, likely used for bibliographic data. (98 words)
