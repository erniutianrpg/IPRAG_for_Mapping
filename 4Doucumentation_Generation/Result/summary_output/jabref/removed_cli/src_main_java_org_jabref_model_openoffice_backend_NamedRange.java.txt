The `NamedRange` interface provides methods to manage named text ranges (like bookmarks or reference marks) in LibreOffice/OpenOffice documents. It allows retrieving range names, accessing text ranges/cursors, and preparing/cleaning cursors for text insertion. The interface supports operations like getting mark ranges, obtaining raw/fill cursors, cleaning up after insertion, and removing ranges from documents. It's designed to work with both reference marks and bookmarks, though currently only reference mark implementation exists. Methods throw exceptions for document access issues or target errors.
