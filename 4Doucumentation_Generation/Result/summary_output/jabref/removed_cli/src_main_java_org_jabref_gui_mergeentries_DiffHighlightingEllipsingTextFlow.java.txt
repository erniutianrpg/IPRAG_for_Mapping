This JavaFX `DiffHighlightingEllipsingTextFlow` class extends `TextFlow` to display text with diff highlighting (word or character level) and smart ellipsis truncation. It compares `fullText` against a `comparisonString`, highlighting differences based on the selected `DiffMode`. The text is dynamically adjusted to fit within bounds by truncating with ellipsis when overflow occurs. Key features include:
1. Diff highlighting (unchanged/added/removed text)
2. Responsive resizing with ellipsis truncation
3. Support for word or character-level diff modes
4. Customizable ellipsis string
