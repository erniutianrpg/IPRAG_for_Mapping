This code manages field formatting cleanups for BibTeX/BibLaTeX entries in JabRef. It provides predefined cleanup actions (like normalizing dates, pages, or converting HTML to LaTeX) and handles parsing/serializing these actions from/to strings. The main class `FieldFormatterCleanups` applies enabled cleanup actions to BibEntry fields, maintaining state (enabled/disabled) and supporting metadata operations. It includes default and recommended formatters for BibTeX and BibLaTeX formats.
