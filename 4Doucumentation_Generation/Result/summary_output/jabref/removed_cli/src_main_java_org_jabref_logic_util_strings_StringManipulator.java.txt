The `StringManipulator` class provides utility methods for text manipulation operations, primarily focused on word-level changes. It can:
1. Change word casing (uppercase, lowercase, capitalize) from a given position
2. Delete words in either direction (forward or backward) from a cursor position
3. Find word boundaries in text
The class preserves whitespace and returns both modified text and updated cursor positions in a `ResultingStringState` object. It's designed for text editing operations in a word processor-like context.
