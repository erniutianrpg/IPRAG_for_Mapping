This code implements a command-line interface (CLI) for JabRef, a reference management software. It handles various command-line options including:
- Import/export of bibliographic data (BibTeX, AUX files)
- Preferences management (import/export/reset)
- PDF metadata operations (XMP, embedding)
- Version display and help text
- GUI control (disable, blank mode)
- Citation key generation and file linking

The class parses command-line arguments, provides methods to check which options were specified, and displays formatted help/version information. It supports multiple import/export formats and includes utility methods for text wrapping in console output.
