The `NamedRangeManager` interface defines methods to manage named ranges in a text document (likely OpenOffice/LibreOffice). It allows creating named ranges at cursor positions (with options for spacing and brackets), retrieving a list of used range names, and fetching a specific named range by its name. The methods throw exceptions for document access issues or creation failures. This interface serves as a backend for handling named ranges in document editing operations. (98 words)
