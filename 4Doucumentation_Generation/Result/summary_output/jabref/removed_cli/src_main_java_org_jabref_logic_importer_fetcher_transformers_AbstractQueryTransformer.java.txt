This code defines an `AbstractQueryTransformer` class that converts Lucene query nodes into a library-specific query string. It handles various query types (Boolean, Field, Group, Modifier) and field-specific terms (author, title, journal, year, etc.), applying appropriate transformations for each. The class provides abstract methods for logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) and field handling, allowing subclasses to implement library-specific syntax. It also manages year ranges and removes unnecessary outer braces from the final query.
