The `Localization` class manages translations for JabRef, handling language-specific messages and menu entries. It loads translations from resource bundles, caches them in a `LocalizationBundle` for fast access, and replaces placeholders (e.g., `%0`, `%1`) in messages with provided parameters. The class supports setting the preferred language (defaulting to English if unsupported) and provides methods like `lang()` to retrieve translated strings. It logs warnings for missing translations or unsupported languages. The implementation ensures efficient lookup and parameter substitution for localized strings.
