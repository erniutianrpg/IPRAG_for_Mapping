This code provides utility methods for working with OpenOffice/LibreOffice UNO (Universal Network Objects) properties. It includes methods to:
1. Convert property containers to property sets
2. Retrieve property set information
3. Get property names from various sources (Property arrays, XPropertySetInfo, XPropertySet, XPropertyContainer)
4. Get property values as objects, handling unknown properties gracefully
5. All methods are null-safe and return Optional or empty collections when appropriate

The utilities help interact with UNO API properties in a more convenient and safe manner.
