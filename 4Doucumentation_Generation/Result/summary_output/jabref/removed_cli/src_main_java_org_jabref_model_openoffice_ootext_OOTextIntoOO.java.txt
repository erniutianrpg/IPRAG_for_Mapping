This code provides functionality to insert formatted text into an OpenOffice/LibreOffice document using HTML-like tags for styling. Key features include:

1. Parses HTML-style tags (like `<b>`, `<i>`, `<sup>`) and applies corresponding formatting (bold, italic, superscript, etc.)
2. Handles paragraph breaks and style changes
3. Manages a stack of formatting properties to properly handle nested tags
4. Supports special OpenOffice-specific attributes for paragraph and character styles
5. Includes utilities for removing direct formatting and checking property states

The main `write()` method processes marked-up text and applies the formatting at the cursor position in the document while maintaining proper tag nesting. The code interacts with OpenOffice's UNO API to manipulate document properties and text formatting.
