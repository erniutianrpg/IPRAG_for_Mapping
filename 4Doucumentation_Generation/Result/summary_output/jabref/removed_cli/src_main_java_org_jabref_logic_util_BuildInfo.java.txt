The `BuildInfo` class reads build properties from a file (default: `/build.properties`) to provide application metadata. It stores version information, maintainer details, API keys (with defaults), OS/JVM details, and Java version requirements. If properties are missing, it uses default values. The class also cleans property values by removing Gradle variable references. This is typically used to centralize build-time configuration for an application.
