This code provides utility methods to control screen refresh in an OpenOffice document. It uses `lockControllers()` to disable screen updates (preventing display notifications) and `unlockControllers()` to re-enable them. The `hasControllersLocked()` method checks if the document's controllers are currently locked. These methods help optimize performance by reducing unnecessary UI updates during batch operations. All methods operate on an `XTextDocument` from the OpenOffice API.
