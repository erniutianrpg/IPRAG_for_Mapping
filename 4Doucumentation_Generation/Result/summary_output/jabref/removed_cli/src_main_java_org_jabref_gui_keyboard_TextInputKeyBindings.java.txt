This code handles keyboard shortcuts for text input controls in a JavaFX application. It checks if the focused element is a text field, then maps key events to actions like deleting characters, moving the cursor, modifying text case (capitalize, lowercase, uppercase), and clearing text. Each action consumes the event to prevent default handling. The bindings are retrieved from a global key binding repository.
