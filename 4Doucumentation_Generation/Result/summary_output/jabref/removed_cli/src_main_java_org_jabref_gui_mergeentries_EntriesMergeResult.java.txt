The `EntriesMergeResult` class is a simple Java record that holds the results of merging two BibTeX entries (`BibEntry`). It stores the original left and right entries (`originalLeftEntry`, `originalRightEntry`), their potentially modified versions after merging (`newLeftEntry`, `newRightEntry`), and the final merged entry (`mergedEntry`). This immutable data structure serves as a container for the merge operation's outcome. (58 words)
