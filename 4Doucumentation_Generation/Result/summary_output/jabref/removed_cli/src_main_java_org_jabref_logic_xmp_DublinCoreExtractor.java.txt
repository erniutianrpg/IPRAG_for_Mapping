The `DublinCoreExtractor` class facilitates bidirectional conversion between BibTeX entries and Dublin Core metadata (XMP). It extracts Dublin Core fields (like creator, title, date) into a `BibEntry` object and vice versa. Key features include handling standard fields (author, publisher, DOI), custom fields via relation attributes, privacy filtering, and special cases like dates and keywords. The class ensures compatibility between BibTeX and Dublin Core schemas while preserving field semantics.
