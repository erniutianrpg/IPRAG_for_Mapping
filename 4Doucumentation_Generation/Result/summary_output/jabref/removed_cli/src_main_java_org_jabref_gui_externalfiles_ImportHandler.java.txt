The `ImportHandler` class manages the import of external files and data into a JabRef bibliography database. It handles various file types (PDF, BibTeX) and data formats (DOI, arXiv IDs), performs duplicate checks, generates citation keys, and links files to entries. It also supports background processing, undo operations, and adding entries to groups. The class integrates with JabRef's UI and preferences system to provide a comprehensive import solution with error handling and user feedback.
