This code provides a utility method `insertNamedTextContent` to insert named text elements (like bookmarks, reference marks, or text sections) into a LibreOffice/OpenOffice document. It takes a document, service type, name, text range, and absorb flag as inputs. The method creates the specified service instance, sets its name, and inserts it at the given range. The `absorb` flag determines whether the range's text is incorporated into the new element. It returns the `XNamed` interface of the created element. The method handles type casting and throws exceptions for failures.
