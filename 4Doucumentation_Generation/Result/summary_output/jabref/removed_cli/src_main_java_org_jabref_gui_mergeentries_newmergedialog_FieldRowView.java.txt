The `FieldRowView` class manages the display and merging of field values in a three-way merge interface for BibTeX entries. It coordinates between left, right, and merged field values, handles user selection (left/right/none), toggles merge states, and highlights differences between values. The class uses cells (`FieldNameCell`, `FieldValueCell`, `MergedFieldCell`) to represent each field and provides methods to show/hide rows and diff highlighting. It binds properties to a view model (`FieldRowViewModel`) for state management and merges fields when requested.
