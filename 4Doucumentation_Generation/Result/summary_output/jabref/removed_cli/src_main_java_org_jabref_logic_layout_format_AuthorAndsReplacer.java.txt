The `AuthorAndsReplacer` class formats author lists in a bibliography. It replaces " and " separators with " & " for two authors, and uses semicolons followed by " & " for lists with more than two authors (e.g., "Author1; Author2 & Author3"). If the input is null, it returns null. For a single author, it returns the name unchanged. This formatter helps standardize author name separators in citation outputs.
