The `SourceTab` class in JabRef provides a GUI tab for viewing and editing BibTeX entry source code directly. It includes:

1. A text editor (`CodeArea`) for BibTeX source with syntax highlighting and search functionality.
2. Undo/redo support via `UndoManager`.
3. Validation of BibTeX syntax and field values.
4. Context menu for basic editing (cut/copy/paste).
5. Synchronization between source edits and the BibEntry object.
6. Keyboard shortcuts for save operations.
7. Input method handling for international text input.

The tab automatically updates when entry fields change and validates source code when focus is lost or on save.
