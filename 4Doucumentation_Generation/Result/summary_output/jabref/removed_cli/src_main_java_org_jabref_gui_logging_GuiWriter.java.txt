The `GuiWriter` class is a custom log writer for JabRef that extends `AbstractFormatPatternWriter`. It captures all log entry values (message, level, exception, etc.) and forwards them to JabRef's `LogMessages` singleton instance via the `write()` method. The `flush()` and `close()` methods are empty as no additional cleanup is needed. This writer is used to display log messages in JabRef's GUI.
