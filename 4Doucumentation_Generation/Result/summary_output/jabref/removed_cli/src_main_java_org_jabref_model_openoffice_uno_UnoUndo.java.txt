This code provides utility methods for managing undo operations in OpenOffice/LibreOffice documents. It retrieves the document's `XUndoManager` to group changes into undoable actions. The `enterUndoContext` starts a named undoable group, while `leaveUndoContext` ends it. Both must be called in pairs to maintain consistency. The code handles potential `InvalidStateException` during context leaving. It uses Optional to safely handle potential null values.
