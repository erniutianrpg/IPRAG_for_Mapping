This JavaFX code implements a global search results dialog for JabRef, a reference management software. The dialog displays search results in a table with a preview pane, allowing users to view entries from open libraries. It includes features like: keeping the window on top, remembering window size preferences, and synchronizing selection between the table and preview. The dialog is non-modal and uses MVVM architecture with dependency injection for services like preferences, state management, and theming.
