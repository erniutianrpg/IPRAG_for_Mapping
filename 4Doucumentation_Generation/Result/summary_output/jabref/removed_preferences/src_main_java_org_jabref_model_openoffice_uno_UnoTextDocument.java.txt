This code provides utility methods for interacting with an OpenOffice/LibreOffice text document (XTextDocument) via UNO API. Key functionalities include: checking if the document connection is missing (isDocumentConnectionMissing), retrieving the current controller (getCurrentController), getting the document window title (getFrameTitle), and accessing document properties (getDocumentProperties). It handles null checks and exceptions gracefully, returning Optional values where appropriate. The methods help manage document interactions while avoiding null pointer and connection issues.
