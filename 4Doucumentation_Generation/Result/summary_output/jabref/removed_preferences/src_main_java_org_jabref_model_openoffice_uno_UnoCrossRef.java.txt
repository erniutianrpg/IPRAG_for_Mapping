This code provides functionality for working with cross-references in OpenOffice/LibreOffice documents. It has two main features: 

1. `refresh()` - Updates all text fields (including cross-references) in the document.
2. `insertReferenceToPageNumberOfReferenceMark()` - Inserts a clickable cross-reference that displays the page number of a specified reference mark. It creates a "GetReference" field, configures it to point to a reference mark and show the page number, then inserts it at a specified cursor position.

The code uses OpenOffice's UNO API to interact with document elements and handle potential property-related exceptions.
