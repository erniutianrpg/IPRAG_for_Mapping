The `GuiPreferences` class manages JavaFX-based GUI preferences for JabRef, including window properties (position, size, maximized state), recently opened files, merge entry settings (diff modes, highlighting), and side pane width. It uses JavaFX properties for observable values, allowing automatic UI updates when preferences change. The class provides getter/setter methods for all properties, enabling storage and retrieval of user interface settings across sessions.
