The `UnifiedDiffHighlighter` class highlights differences between two text areas by unifying changes into insertions and deletions. It compares source and target text, identifies changes using a diff algorithm, and marks them with styles (e.g., "addition" or "deletion"). For changed text, it shows both the deleted source and inserted target words. The result is displayed in the target text area with appropriate styling to visualize additions, deletions, and unchanged text. The class ensures changes are clearly distinguishable while maintaining readability.
