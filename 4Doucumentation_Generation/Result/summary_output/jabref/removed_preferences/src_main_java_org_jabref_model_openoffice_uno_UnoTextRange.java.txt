This Java utility class `UnoTextRange` provides methods for working with text ranges in OpenOffice/LibreOffice documents. Key functionalities include: 
1. Retrieving a footnote marker range if the given range is in a footnote (`getFootnoteMarkRange`).
2. Comparing text ranges by their start/end positions (`compareStarts`, `compareEnds`, `compareStartsThenEnds`), with checks for comparable ranges.
3. All methods follow Java conventions for comparison results (1 for greater, -1 for lesser). The class throws exceptions for incomparable ranges.
