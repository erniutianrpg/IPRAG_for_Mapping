The `PreviewPreferences` class manages preview-related settings in JabRef, including a cycle of preview layouts, their positions, a custom layout, and display options. It stores these preferences as observable properties, allowing UI bindings and change notifications. Key functionalities include getting/setting the current layout position, retrieving the selected layout (falling back to custom layout if needed), and managing whether the preview appears as an extra tab. The class ensures valid layout positions through modulo arithmetic when setting positions.
