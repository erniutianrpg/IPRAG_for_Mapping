This code provides utility methods for working with text sections in LibreOffice/OpenOffice documents via UNO API. It allows: 1) accessing sections by name, 2) retrieving section ranges, and 3) creating new text sections. The methods handle document exceptions and return Optional when sections might not exist. The create() method inserts sections at specified locations, with LibreOffice auto-renaming duplicates. The class acts as a bridge between Java and LibreOffice's UNO interface for text section manipulation.
