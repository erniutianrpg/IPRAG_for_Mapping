The `CopyMoreAction` class in JabRef provides various copy operations for BibTeX entries, including copying titles, citation keys, DOI URLs, and formatted combinations of keys with titles or links. It handles selection validation, formats the output appropriately, copies to clipboard, and shows notifications about successful operations or missing data. The actions are triggered through a command pattern and support different output formats (plain text, HTML).
