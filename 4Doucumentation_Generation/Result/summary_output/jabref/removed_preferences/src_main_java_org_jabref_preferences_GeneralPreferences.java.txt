The `GeneralPreferences` class manages user preferences in a JavaFX application (JabRef). It stores and provides access to settings like language, default database mode, and various boolean flags (e.g., warning about duplicates, delete confirmation, memory stick mode). Each preference is wrapped in a JavaFX property for observable behavior, with getter/setter methods for access and modification. This enables reactive UI updates when preferences change.
