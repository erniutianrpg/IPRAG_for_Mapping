This code defines a custom annotation `@ApacheCommonsLang3Allowed` used to mark code where Apache Commons Lang3 usage is permitted. The annotation's purpose is to encourage using Google Guava instead, restricting Apache Commons Lang3 to cases where no alternative exists. The annotation includes a `value` field to document the rationale for its use.
