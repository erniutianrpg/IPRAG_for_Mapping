The `OOFrontend` class manages citation groups in an OpenOffice/LibreOffice document. It provides functionality to:
- Read, create, and remove citation groups
- Sort citations visually or within document partitions
- Check for overlapping ranges between citations and other elements
- Retrieve and apply citation entries
- Manage global citation order
- Handle footnotes and bibliography marks

It acts as an intermediary between the UI and backend, handling document operations while maintaining citation group state. The class includes error handling for document-related exceptions and supports operations like health checks and overlap detection.
