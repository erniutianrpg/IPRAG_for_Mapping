This code provides utility methods for managing undo operations in OpenOffice/LibreOffice documents. It retrieves an `XUndoManager` instance from a text document and offers two main functions: `enterUndoContext` to start grouping changes under a named undo action, and `leaveUndoContext` to end the grouping. The operations must be paired to maintain consistency in the document's undo stack. The code handles potential `InvalidStateException` during context leaving.
