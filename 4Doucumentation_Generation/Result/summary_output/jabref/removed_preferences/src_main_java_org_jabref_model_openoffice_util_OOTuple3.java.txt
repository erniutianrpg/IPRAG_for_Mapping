The `OOTuple3` class is a simple generic container that groups three objects of different types (`A`, `B`, `C`) into a single immutable tuple. It provides public final fields (`a`, `b`, `c`) to access the stored values and a constructor to initialize them. This utility class avoids the need to create a custom class for holding three related objects, similar to a triple or trio container. (78 words)
