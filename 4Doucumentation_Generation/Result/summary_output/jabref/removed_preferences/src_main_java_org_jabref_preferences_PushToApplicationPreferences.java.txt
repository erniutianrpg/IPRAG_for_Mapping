This Java class `PushToApplicationPreferences` manages preferences for pushing content to external applications. It stores: the active application name, command paths for applications, Emacs arguments, and Vim server details. Using JavaFX properties, it provides getter/setter methods for each preference, enabling observable updates. The class encapsulates these preferences as observable properties, allowing UI components to bind to and track changes automatically.
