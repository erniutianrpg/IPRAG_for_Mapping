This code provides utility methods for managing reference marks in an OpenOffice/LibreOffice text document via UNO API. Key functionalities include: retrieving all reference mark names, removing a mark by name, getting a mark's content or position, and creating new reference marks. It handles document connection checks and exceptions like missing elements or disposed documents. The methods work with the document's XTextDocument interface to manipulate reference marks as named text contents.
