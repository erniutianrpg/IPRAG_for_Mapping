The `RemoteClient` class enables communication with a remote JabRef instance over a specified port. It provides two main functions: `ping()` checks if a server is available and responsive by sending a PING message and expecting a PONG response, and `sendCommandLineArguments()` transmits command-line arguments to an already running JabRef instance. Both methods return `true` on success or `false` on failure, logging errors if the connection or communication fails. The connection is established via a socket with a timeout.
