The `ExternalApplicationsPreferences` class manages user preferences for external applications in JabRef, including email settings (subject, auto-open attachments), citation commands, and custom terminal/file browser configurations. It uses JavaFX properties to store and provide observable access to these preferences, with getter/setter methods for each property. The class encapsulates settings for integrating with external tools while supporting property binding and change notifications.
