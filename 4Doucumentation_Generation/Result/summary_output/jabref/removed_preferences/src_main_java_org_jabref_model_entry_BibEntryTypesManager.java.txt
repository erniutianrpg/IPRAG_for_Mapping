The `BibEntryTypesManager` class manages BibTeX and BibLaTeX entry types, handling both standard and custom/modified types. It provides methods to:
- Retrieve all custom types for a given database mode
- Check if a type is custom or modified
- Add, remove, or clear custom/modified types
- Enrich entry types with additional information
- Compare types for differences

The class internally separates standard types (BibTeX/BibLaTeX) from custom ones, using `InternalEntryTypes` to organize and query them efficiently. It supports operations like type lookup, comparison, and customization management.
