This Java record `RecordInfo` represents metadata about a record, storing two lists: `recordContents` (for record information) and `languages`. It includes a static set `elementNameSet` containing predefined record-related field names (e.g., "recordIdentifier", "recordCreationDate"). The constructor initializes empty lists if no arguments are provided. The record is part of a MODS (Metadata Object Description Schema) importer logic. (98 words)
