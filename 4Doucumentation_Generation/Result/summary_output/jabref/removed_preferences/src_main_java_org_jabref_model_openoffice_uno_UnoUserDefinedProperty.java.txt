This code provides utility methods for managing user-defined properties in LibreOffice/OpenOffice text documents. It allows:

1. Retrieving the property container and listing property names
2. Getting and setting string values for custom properties (creating them if needed)
3. Removing properties (with options to warn or silently handle missing properties)

The properties correspond to those accessible via [File]/[Properties]/[Custom Properties] in LibreOffice's GUI. The class handles UNO API exceptions and provides Optional returns for safer property access.
