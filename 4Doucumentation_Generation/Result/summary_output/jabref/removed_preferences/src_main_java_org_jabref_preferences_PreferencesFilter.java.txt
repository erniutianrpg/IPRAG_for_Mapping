The `PreferencesFilter` class manages and compares application preferences against their default values. It provides methods to: 
1. Retrieve all preference options (`getPreferenceOptions`) as a list of `PreferenceOption` objects (key, current value, default value).
2. Identify changed preferences (`getDeviatingPreferences`) by filtering options where current values differ from defaults. 
The `PreferenceOption` inner class encapsulates individual preferences, enforces type safety (BOOLEAN/INTEGER/STRING), and implements comparison by key. It also provides methods to check if a preference value has been modified from its default.
