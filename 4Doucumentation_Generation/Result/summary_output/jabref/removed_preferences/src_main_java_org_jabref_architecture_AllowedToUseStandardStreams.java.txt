This code defines a custom annotation `@AllowedToUseStandardStreams` in Java, specifically for JabRef. The annotation marks classes that are permitted to use standard output streams (`System.out`/`System.err`) instead of the logging framework. It includes a mandatory `value` field to provide the rationale for this exception. The annotation serves as documentation and potentially for static analysis checks. (49 words)
