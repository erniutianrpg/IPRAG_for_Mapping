The `EnglishStemAnalyzer` class extends Lucene's `Analyzer` to process text for search. It tokenizes input using `StandardTokenizer`, converts tokens to lowercase, removes English stop words, preserves numbers via `DecimalDigitFilter`, and applies Porter stemming to reduce words to their root forms. This enhances search relevance by normalizing terms.
