The `OpenOfficePanel` class provides a GUI interface for integrating JabRef with OpenOffice/LibreOffice. It allows users to:
- Connect to OpenOffice automatically or manually
- Select documents and citation styles
- Insert, manage, and update citations in documents
- Export cited references
- Configure settings like auto-sync and database lookup scope

The panel handles citation operations (normal, in-text, empty, advanced) and manages document synchronization with OpenOffice while providing error handling and user feedback. It maintains connection states and updates button availability based on the current context.
