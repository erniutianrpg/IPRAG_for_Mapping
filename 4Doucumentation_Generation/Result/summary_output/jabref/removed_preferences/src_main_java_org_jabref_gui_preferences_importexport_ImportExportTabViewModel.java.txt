The `ImportExportTabViewModel` class manages import/export preferences for JabRef, including API keys, DOI settings, Grobid options, file download preferences, and export sorting configurations. It initializes values from preferences, stores updated settings, and provides properties for UI binding. It also includes a method to validate custom API keys by testing their connection to respective services. The class acts as an intermediary between the preferences UI and the underlying preferences storage system.
