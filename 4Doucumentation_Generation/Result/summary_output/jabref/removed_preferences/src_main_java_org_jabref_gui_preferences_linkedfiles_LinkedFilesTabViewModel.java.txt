This code implements a ViewModel for managing linked file preferences in JabRef. It handles settings for file storage locations (relative to Bib file or main directory), filename patterns, full-text indexing, and auto-linking behavior (matching files by citation key start, exact match, or regex). The class includes validation for directory paths, methods to browse/set directories, and properties to bind with UI elements. It saves/loads preferences through `PreferencesService` and provides validation feedback via `DialogService`.
