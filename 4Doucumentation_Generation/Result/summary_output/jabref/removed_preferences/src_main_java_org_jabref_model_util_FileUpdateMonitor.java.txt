The `FileUpdateMonitor` interface defines methods to monitor file changes: adding/removing listeners for specific files (`addListenerForFile`, `removeListener`), checking if the monitor is active (`isActive`), and shutting down the monitoring process (`shutdown`). It enables tracking file modifications and notifying registered listeners.
