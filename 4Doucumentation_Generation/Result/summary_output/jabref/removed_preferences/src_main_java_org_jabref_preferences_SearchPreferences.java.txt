The `SearchPreferences` class manages search-related settings in JabRef, including display mode (e.g., floating window), search flags (case sensitivity, regex, fulltext, etc.), window positioning (keep on top), and window dimensions (width/height). It uses JavaFX properties for observable values, allowing UI bindings. The class provides methods to get/set these preferences and check flag states.
