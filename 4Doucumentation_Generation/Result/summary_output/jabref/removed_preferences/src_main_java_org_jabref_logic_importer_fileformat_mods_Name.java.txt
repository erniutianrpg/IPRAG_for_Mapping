The code defines a simple immutable Java record `Name` with two fields: `value` and `type`. Records automatically provide implementations of `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()`. This class appears to represent a name with an associated type, likely used in the context of MODS (Metadata Object Description Schema) metadata handling within the JabRef reference management software. The record's concise syntax eliminates boilerplate code for a basic data carrier class.
