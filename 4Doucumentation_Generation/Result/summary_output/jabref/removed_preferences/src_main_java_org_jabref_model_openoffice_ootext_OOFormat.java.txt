The `OOFormat` class provides helper methods to generate OpenOffice (OO) text markup for formatting text in citations and bibliographies. It includes functions to:  
1. Set character locale (language/country) or mark text as language-neutral  
2. Apply character styles  
3. Format text as paragraphs with optional style  
4. Create cross-references to page numbers of reference marks  

The methods wrap input text in appropriate OO markup tags for localization, styling, and structure. The class doesn't cover all OO markup tags, only those needed for citation-related formatting.
