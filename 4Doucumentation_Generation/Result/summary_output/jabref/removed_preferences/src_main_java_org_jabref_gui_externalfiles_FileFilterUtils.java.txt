This code provides utility methods for filtering and sorting files based on their last modified timestamps. Key functionalities include: 
1. Retrieving a file's last modified time as `LocalDateTime`.
2. Checking if a file was modified within specific time ranges (day, week, month, year).
3. Filtering files by a specified date range (`DateRange` enum).
4. Sorting files in ascending or descending order based on modification time.
5. A general sorting method that delegates to specific sorters based on an `ExternalFileSorter` enum.
