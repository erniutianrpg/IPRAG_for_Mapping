The `SidePaneViewModel` class manages a side panel interface in JabRef, handling the visibility, ordering, and positioning of different side pane components (like Groups, Web Search, etc.). It tracks visible panes, allows moving them up/down, and persists their preferred positions via preferences. Components are created on-demand and cached. The class also provides commands for closing panes and adjusting their order, synchronizing changes with user preferences.
