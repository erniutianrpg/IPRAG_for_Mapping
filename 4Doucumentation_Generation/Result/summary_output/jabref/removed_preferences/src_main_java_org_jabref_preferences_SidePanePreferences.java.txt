The `SidePanePreferences` class manages preferences for a side pane in a JavaFX application. It tracks visible panes (`SidePaneType`), their preferred positions, and the selected web search fetcher. The class provides observable properties for UI binding, getter/setter methods for visibility and positions, and maintains the selected fetcher state. All preferences are stored in observable collections for automatic UI updates. (98 words)
