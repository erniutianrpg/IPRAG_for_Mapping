This Java utility class `UnoScreenRefresh` controls screen refresh in OpenOffice documents. It provides static methods to `lockControllers()` (disable screen updates), `unlockControllers()` (enable updates), and `hasControllersLocked()` (check lock status) on an `XTextDocument`. Locking controllers prevents display updates until unlocked, improving performance during batch operations. The class follows a singleton pattern with a private constructor.
