The `PreferencesMigrations` class handles the migration of user preferences when upgrading JabRef to newer versions. It performs various upgrades including:

1. Moving preferences from old paths to new ones
2. Fixing encoding strings
3. Updating sort orders
4. Migrating citation key patterns
5. Converting key bindings to JavaFX format
6. Updating column preferences and preview styles
7. Cleaning up old cleanup preferences format

The class ensures backward compatibility while transitioning to new preference formats across different JabRef versions. Each migration method targets specific preference changes needed for version upgrades.
