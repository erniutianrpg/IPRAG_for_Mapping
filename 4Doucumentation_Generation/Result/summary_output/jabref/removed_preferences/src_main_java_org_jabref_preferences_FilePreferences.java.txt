The `FilePreferences` class manages file-related preferences in JabRef, including file storage locations, naming patterns, and handling of linked files. It uses JavaFX properties for observable values, storing settings like main file directory, relative file storage flag, filename/directory patterns, download/fulltext indexing options, working directory, and supported external file types. The class provides getters, setters, and property accessors for these preferences, with some methods returning `Optional` for nullable fields. Default filename patterns are provided as constants.
