The `DoiFetcher` class is a DOI-based fetcher for JabRef that retrieves bibliographic entries by querying DOI registration agencies (Crossref, DataCite, mEDRA). It handles API rate limiting, performs content negotiation to fetch BibTeX data, and cleans up the retrieved entries. The fetcher also checks for APS journal entries and updates Crossref's dynamic rate limits. It implements both ID-based and entry-based fetching interfaces.
