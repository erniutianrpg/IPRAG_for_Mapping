The `ExternalProcessExecutor` class executes external system commands with a timeout. It provides two methods: a deprecated one that splits a command string by whitespace, and a preferred one that takes a command list. Both methods run the command, discard output/errors, and return true only if the command completes successfully (exit code 0) within the specified timeout. If the process times out or fails, it logs the error and returns false. The class handles OS differences by redirecting output to `/dev/null` or `NUL`.
