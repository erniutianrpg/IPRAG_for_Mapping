This Java class `BbbAppsIsAliveMessage` represents a heartbeat message for BigBlueButton applications. It tracks two timestamps: when the message was sent (`timestamp`) and when the app started (`startedOn`). The class provides methods to convert the message to JSON (`toJson()`) and parse it from JSON (`fromJson()`). The message type is identified by the constant `BBB_APPS_IS_ALIVE`. The version `0.0.1` indicates it's a basic implementation for monitoring app liveliness.
