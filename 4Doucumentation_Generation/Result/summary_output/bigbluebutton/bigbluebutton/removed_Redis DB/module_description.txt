This module provides core messaging and data handling functionality for a BigBlueButton web conferencing system, facilitating communication between components and managing meeting-related data. It includes message classes for user events (role changes, webcam sharing, lock status), meeting properties, and system operations (keep-alive, STUN/TURN requests), along with utilities for recording management (import/export of metadata) and presentation validation. The module serves as a foundational layer for real-time collaboration features and system administration tasks in the platform.
