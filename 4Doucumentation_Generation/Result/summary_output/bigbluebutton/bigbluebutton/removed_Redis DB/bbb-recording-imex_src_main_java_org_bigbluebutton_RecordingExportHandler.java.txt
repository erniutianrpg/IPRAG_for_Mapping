The `RecordingExportHandler` class exports BigBlueButton recordings as XML files. It provides methods to export either all recordings or a specific one by record ID. For each recording, it creates a directory named after the recording ID, generates a `metadata.xml` file containing the recording data (converted from a Recording object to XML), and saves it with proper XML formatting (UTF-8 encoding, indentation). The class uses singleton pattern for instantiation and logs each step, handling errors gracefully. Dependencies include `DataStore` for recording data and `XmlService` for XML conversion.
