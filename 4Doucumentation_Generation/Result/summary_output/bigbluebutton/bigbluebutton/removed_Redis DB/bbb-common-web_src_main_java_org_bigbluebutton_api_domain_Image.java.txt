The code defines an `Image` class representing an XML image element with width, height, and alt attributes, plus a text value (typically a URL). It uses Jackson XML annotations to map Java fields to XML attributes and content. The class provides getters and setters for these properties, allowing manipulation of image metadata and source URL. This is likely used for serializing/deserializing image data in XML format, such as in API responses or configuration files.
