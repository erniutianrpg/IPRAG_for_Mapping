The `MessageDistributor` class facilitates pub/sub message distribution in Redis. It maintains a set of `MessageHandler` listeners and a `ReceivedMessageHandler`. When `notifyListeners` is called with a message, it broadcasts the message to all registered listeners by invoking their `handleMessage` method with the message details (pattern, channel, content). The `setMessageHandler` method also links the handler back to this distributor. Essentially, it acts as a middleman to relay messages from Redis to multiple subscribers. (98 words)
