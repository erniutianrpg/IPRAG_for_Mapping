This code defines a `Recordings` class that retrieves a list of meeting recordings from a specified directory. The `getRecordings` method takes a directory path, filters for subdirectories (each representing a meeting recording), and returns an array of directory names (meeting IDs). Essentially, it lists all meeting recordings stored as subdirectories in the given recording directory.
