This code implements a callback URL service that processes meeting-ended events. It uses a delay queue to handle retries with increasing delays (30s, 1m, 2m, 5m) for failed callbacks, up to 5 attempts. The service makes HTTP GET requests to callback URLs, logs success/failure analytics data in JSON format, and gives up after max retries. It runs asynchronously with single-threaded executors for message processing and task execution. The service supports starting/stopping and handles redirects (though currently disabled).
