The `DelayCallback` class implements `Delayed` to schedule callback events with a specified delay. It stores a callback event (`ICallbackEvent`), execution time (`callTime`), and attempt count (`numAttempts`). The `getDelay()` method calculates remaining time until execution, while `compareTo()` orders instances by their scheduled times. This enables delayed task processing, typically in a priority queue.
