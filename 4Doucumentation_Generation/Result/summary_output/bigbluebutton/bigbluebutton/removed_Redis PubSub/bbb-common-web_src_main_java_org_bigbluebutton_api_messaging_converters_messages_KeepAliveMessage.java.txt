The `KeepAliveMessage` class is a simple Java message container for keep-alive requests in a messaging system. It defines constants for the message type (`KEEP_ALIVE_REQUEST`) and version (`0.0.1`), and stores a `keepAliveId` string passed via its constructor. This class appears to be used for maintaining connection liveliness in a distributed system like BigBlueButton. (59 words)
