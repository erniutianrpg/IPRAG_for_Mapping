The `RecordingImportHandler` class manages the import of recording metadata from XML files. It scans a specified directory for recordings, checks if they exist in the `DataStore`, and imports new recordings by parsing their `metadata.xml` files using an `XmlService`. The imported recordings are optionally persisted to the `DataStore`. The class follows a singleton pattern and logs operations using SLF4J. Key methods include `importRecordings` (batch import) and `importRecording` (single import).
