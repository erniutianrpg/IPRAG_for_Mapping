The code defines a simple Java class `UnpublishedRecordingMessage` that represents a message for an unpublished recording event. It contains constants for the event name (`UNPUBLISHED_RECORDING_EVENT`) and version (`VERSION`), and a `recordId` field to store the recording identifier. The class constructor initializes this `recordId`. This appears to be part of a messaging system for handling recording unpublishing events in a BigBlueButton (an open-source webinar system) API.
