The `RecordingExportHandler` class exports recording metadata to XML files. It provides methods to export all recordings or a specific recording by ID to a specified directory. For each recording, it creates a directory named after the recording ID, generates an XML file (`metadata.xml`) containing the recording's data (converted via `XmlService`), and saves it with proper formatting (UTF-8, indented). The class uses a singleton pattern and logs operations and errors. Dependencies include `DataStore` for recording data and `XmlService` for XML conversion.
