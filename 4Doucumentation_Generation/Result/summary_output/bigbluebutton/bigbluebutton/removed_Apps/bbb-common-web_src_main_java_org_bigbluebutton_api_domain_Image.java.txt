This Java class `Image` represents an XML image element with attributes (width, height, alt) and a text value (URL). It uses Jackson XML annotations to map these properties to XML attributes and content. The class provides getters and setters for width, height, alternative text, and the image URL value, enabling serialization/deserialization of image data in XML format.
