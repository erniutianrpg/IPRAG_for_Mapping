The `Metadata` class stores key-value pairs in a `TreeMap` and provides methods to manage them. It supports JSON/XML serialization via Jackson annotations (`@JsonAnyGetter` and `@JsonAnySetter`), allowing dynamic addition and retrieval of metadata. It also includes methods to remove entries (`remove`) and check for key existence (`containsKey`). The class is designed to handle flexible metadata storage and serialization. (99 words)
