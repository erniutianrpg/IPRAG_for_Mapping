This code defines an abstract `RedisAwareCommunicator` class that provides core Redis connection functionality for BigBlueButton. It handles Redis client setup, connection events (connected, activated, deactivated, disconnected), and connection pooling configuration. The class includes methods to set connection parameters (host, port, password) and manage the Redis client lifecycle (start/stop). It also implements logging for connection status changes and provides a default connection pool configuration. Concrete subclasses must implement the start/stop methods for specific Redis communication needs.
