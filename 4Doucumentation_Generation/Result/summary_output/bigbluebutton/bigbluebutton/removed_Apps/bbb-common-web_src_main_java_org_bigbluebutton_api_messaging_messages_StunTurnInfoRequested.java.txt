The code defines a `StunTurnInfoRequested` message class that implements `IMessage`. It contains two fields: `meetingId` and `internalUserId`, which are set via the constructor. This class appears to represent a request for STUN/TURN server information (used for WebRTC connections) for a specific meeting and user in a messaging system. The message is immutable (fields are final).
