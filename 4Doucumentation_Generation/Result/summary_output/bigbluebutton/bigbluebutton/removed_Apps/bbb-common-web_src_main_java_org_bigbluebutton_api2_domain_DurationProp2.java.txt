The `DurationProp2` class is a simple data container that stores timing-related properties: a duration (as an Integer) and three timestamps (createdTime, startTime, endTime) as longs. It provides a constructor to initialize these immutable fields. The class appears to track the lifespan or duration of an event in a system, likely for meeting or session management in the BigBlueButton API. (58 words)
