The `MeetingEndedEvent` class is a simple Java data structure that represents a meeting-ended callback event. It stores meeting details (ID, external ID, name) and a callback URL. The class implements `ICallbackEvent` and provides getter methods for these fields, allowing other code to access the meeting information and callback URL when a meeting ends. (50 words)
