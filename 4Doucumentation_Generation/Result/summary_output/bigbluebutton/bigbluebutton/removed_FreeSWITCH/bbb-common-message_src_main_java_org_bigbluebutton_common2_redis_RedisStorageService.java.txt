This code implements a Redis storage service for BigBlueButton, handling meeting data and operations. It connects to Redis, manages meeting info, recordings, breakout rooms, and presentation annotations. Key features include generating/validating single-use caption tokens, recording meeting events with expiration, storing/retrieving meeting data, and basic connection checks. The service supports CRUD operations on Redis hashes and lists for managing meeting-related data structures.
