The `LearningDashboardService` class manages JSON data files for BigBlueButton's learning dashboard. It provides methods to: 
1. Create/get JSON files for meeting data (`getJsonDataFile`), 
2. Write activity data to JSON files (`writeJsonDataFile`), 
3. Remove files after a delay (`removeJsonDataFile`), and 
4. Delete directories recursively (`deleteDirectory`). 
Files are stored in a configurable directory structure organized by meeting ID and access token.
