This code defines a `RecordingServiceGW` interface for handling recording-related operations in a BigBlueButton API. It includes methods to: retrieve recordings in a specific format (`getRecordings2x`), fetch and save recording metadata (`getRecordingMetadata`, `saveRecordingMetadata`), validate text track tokens (`validateTextTrackSingleUseToken`), and manage text tracks for recordings (`getRecordingTextTracks`, `putRecordingTextTrack`). The interface supports both metadata file operations and caption track management.
