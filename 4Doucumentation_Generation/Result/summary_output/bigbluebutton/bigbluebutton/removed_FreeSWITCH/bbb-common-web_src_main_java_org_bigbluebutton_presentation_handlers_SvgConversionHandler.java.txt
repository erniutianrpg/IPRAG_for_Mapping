The `SvgConversionHandler` class counts the number of `<path>` and `<image>` tags in an SVG file's output. It uses regex patterns to find these tags in the stdout content, extracts the counts by parsing the matched numbers, and returns them. If no tags are found or errors occur, it returns 0 and logs exceptions. This helps track SVG element usage during conversion processes.
