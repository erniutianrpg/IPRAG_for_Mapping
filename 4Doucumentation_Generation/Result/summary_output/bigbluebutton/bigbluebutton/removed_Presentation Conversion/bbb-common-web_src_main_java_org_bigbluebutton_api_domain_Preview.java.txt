This Java class `Preview` represents an XML-serializable object containing an array of `Image` objects. It uses Jackson XML annotations to structure the output, wrapping the images array with an `<images>` tag and each element with an `<image>` tag. The class provides getter and setter methods for accessing and modifying the images array. Essentially, it's a simple data container for image previews in XML format. (74 words)
