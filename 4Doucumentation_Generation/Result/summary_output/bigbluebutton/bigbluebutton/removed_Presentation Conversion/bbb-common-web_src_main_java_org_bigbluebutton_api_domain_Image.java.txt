This Java class `Image` represents an XML image element with attributes (width, height, alt) and a text value (URL). It uses Jackson XML annotations to map these properties when serializing/deserializing XML. The class provides getters and setters for each attribute and the image URL value. The example shows it could represent an image tag with dimensions, alt text, and a source URL.
