The `KeepAliveMessage` interface in the `org.bigbluebutton.web.services` package serves as a marker interface with no defined methods. It likely acts as a placeholder or identifier for keep-alive message types in a larger system, potentially used to maintain active connections or monitor system liveness. Its empty structure suggests it may be implemented by concrete classes that provide actual keep-alive functionality.
