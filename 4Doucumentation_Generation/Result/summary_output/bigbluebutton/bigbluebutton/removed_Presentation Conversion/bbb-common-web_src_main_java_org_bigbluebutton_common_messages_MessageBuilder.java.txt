This code provides utility methods for constructing JSON messages with headers and payloads. The `buildHeader` method creates a message header with name, version, timestamp, and optional reply-to fields. The `buildJson` method combines this header with a payload into a structured JSON message using Gson. The `generateTimestamp` helper method provides timestamps in milliseconds. This is essentially a message builder for creating standardized JSON messages with metadata.
