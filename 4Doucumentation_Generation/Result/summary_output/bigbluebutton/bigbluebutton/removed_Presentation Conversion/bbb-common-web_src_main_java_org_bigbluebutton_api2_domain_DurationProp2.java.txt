The `DurationProp2` class is a simple data container that stores meeting duration-related properties: `duration` (in minutes), `createdTime` (timestamp when created), `startTime` (when meeting starts), and `endTime` (when meeting ends). It provides a constructor to initialize these immutable fields. This class appears to be used for tracking meeting time information in a larger application. (58 words)
