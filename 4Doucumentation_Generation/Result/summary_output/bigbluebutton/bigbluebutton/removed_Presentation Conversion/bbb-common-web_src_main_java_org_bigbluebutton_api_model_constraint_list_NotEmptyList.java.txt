The code defines a custom annotation `@NotEmptyList` that can be applied to methods, fields, parameters, etc. This annotation holds an array of `@NotEmpty` annotations, allowing multiple `@NotEmpty` constraints to be grouped together. It's retained at runtime and can be used for validation purposes to ensure elements are not empty. Essentially, it's a container annotation for multiple `@NotEmpty` constraints. (59 words)
