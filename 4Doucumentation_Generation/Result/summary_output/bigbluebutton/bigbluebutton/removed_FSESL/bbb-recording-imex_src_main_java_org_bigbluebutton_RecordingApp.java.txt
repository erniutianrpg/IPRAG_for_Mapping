This Java application handles importing and exporting recording metadata for BigBlueButton. It offers two modes: 
1) **Command-line mode** for batch processing with options to import/export single or multiple recordings, specifying paths and persistence.
2) **Interactive mode** for step-by-step user guidance through imports/exports, with prompts for paths, recording IDs, and persistence choices. 

The app creates default directories if needed and uses `RecordingImportHandler` and `RecordingExportHandler` for core functionality. It validates inputs and provides usage instructions.
