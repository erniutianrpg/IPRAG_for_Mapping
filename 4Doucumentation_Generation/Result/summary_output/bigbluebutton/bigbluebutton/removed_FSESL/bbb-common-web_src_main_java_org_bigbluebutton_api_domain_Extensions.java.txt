The `Extensions` class is a simple Java POJO (Plain Old Java Object) that holds a `Preview` object. It uses Jackson XML annotations (`@JacksonXmlProperty` and `@JacksonXmlElementWrapper`) to control XML serialization/deserialization. The class provides getter and setter methods for accessing and modifying the `preview` field. This is likely part of an XML-based API response structure where `Extensions` contains optional preview information. (Words: 59)
