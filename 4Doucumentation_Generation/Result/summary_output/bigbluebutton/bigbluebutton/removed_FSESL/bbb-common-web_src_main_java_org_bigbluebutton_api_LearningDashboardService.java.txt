The `LearningDashboardService` class manages learning dashboard data for meetings in BigBlueButton. It provides functionality to: 
1. Create/retrieve JSON data files for meetings with access tokens (`getJsonDataFile`, `writeJsonDataFile`) 
2. Write meeting activity data to JSON files 
3. Remove meeting data files after a configurable delay (`removeJsonDataFile`) 
4. Set a custom directory path for storing files. 
It uses a recursive method to clean up directories and their contents.
