The `UsersProp2` class is a Java data container that stores meeting user-related properties, including guest policies, layout settings, webcam restrictions, user limits, and user data. It holds configurations like maximum users allowed, whether webcams are moderator-only, and guest authentication status, along with maps tracking custom user data, active users (`User2` objects), and registered users. The class is immutable, with all fields declared `final`, initialized via constructor.
