The `KeepAlivePong` class is a simple data structure representing a keep-alive response message. It stores three pieces of information: the originating system name, a timestamp from the web component (bbbWebTimestamp), and a timestamp from the Akka apps component (akkaAppsTimestamp). This class appears to be used for monitoring system connectivity and synchronization between components.
