This code implements a callback URL service that asynchronously processes meeting-ended events. It uses a delay queue to manage retries with increasing delays (30sec, 1min, 2min, 5min) for failed callbacks, giving up after 5 attempts. The service makes HTTP GET requests to callback URLs, logs success/failure analytics data in JSON format, and handles redirects (up to 5). It runs in separate threads for message processing and execution to avoid blocking.
