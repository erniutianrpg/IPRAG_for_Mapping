This code defines a custom Java annotation `@IsBooleanConstraint` for field validation. It ensures a field's value is a boolean by using the `IsBooleanValidator` class. The annotation includes default error messages and can be applied to fields (`FIELD` target) at runtime (`RUNTIME` retention). It's part of Java's Bean Validation framework, with configurable error key, message, validation groups, and payload.
