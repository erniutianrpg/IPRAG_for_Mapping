The `BezierPath` class represents a path consisting of straight lines, quadratic curves, and cubic curves using BÃ©zier control points. Each node in the path has up to three control points (C0, C1, C2) that define the curve's behavior. The class provides methods to manipulate nodes, transform paths, check point containment, and convert the path to other formats like `Path2D.Double` or polyline arrays. It supports both open and closed paths, with configurable winding rules for filling. The implementation includes caching for performance optimization and utilities for geometric operations like chopping, splitting, and joining segments.
