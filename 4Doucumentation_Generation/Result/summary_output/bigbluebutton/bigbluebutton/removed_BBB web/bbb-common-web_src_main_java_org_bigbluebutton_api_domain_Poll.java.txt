This code defines a `Poll` class for the BigBlueButton conferencing system, representing a poll with a title, question, and answers. It includes methods to add/remove answers, generate IDs (though currently returning null), store the poll, and convert poll data to a map. The class tracks meeting ID, poll ID, creation timestamp, and stores answers in a HashMap. Core functionality involves managing poll metadata and answers within a meeting context.
