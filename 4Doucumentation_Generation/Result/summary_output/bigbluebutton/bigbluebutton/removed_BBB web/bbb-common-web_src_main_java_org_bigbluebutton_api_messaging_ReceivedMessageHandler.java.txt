This code implements a message handler that processes incoming messages asynchronously. It uses a producer-consumer pattern with a blocking queue (`receivedMessages`) to handle messages. The `start()` method initializes a single-threaded executor that continuously processes messages from the queue and forwards them to listeners via `MessageDistributor`. The `handleMessage()` method adds incoming messages to the queue. The `stop()` method halts processing. The system ensures thread-safe message distribution while decoupling message reception from processing.
