The `CreateMeetingMessage` class is a Java data structure that represents a meeting creation request in BigBlueButton. It contains fields for meeting details like ID, name, recording settings, passwords, duration, camera limits, disabled features, metadata, and other configuration options. The class serves as a container for all parameters needed to create a new meeting, with a constructor that initializes all these properties. It also defines constants for the message version and event type.
