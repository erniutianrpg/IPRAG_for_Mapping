The `PostChecksum` class extends `Checksum` and represents a checksum validation for POST requests in the BigBlueButton API. It stores request parameters and constructs a query string from them (excluding the checksum) for validation. The class is annotated with `@PostChecksumConstraint` to enforce checksum validation rules. It provides getter/setter methods for the parameters map and inherits API call and checksum fields from its parent class.
