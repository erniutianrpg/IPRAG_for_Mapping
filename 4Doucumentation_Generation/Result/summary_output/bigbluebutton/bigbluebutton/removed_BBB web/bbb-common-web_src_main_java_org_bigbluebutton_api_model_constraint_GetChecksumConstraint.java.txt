This code defines a custom Java annotation `@GetChecksumConstraint` for validating checksums. It's a constraint annotation used at the class level (`TYPE`) that triggers the `GetChecksumValidator` class to perform validation. The annotation includes default values for error messages and configuration, specifying a default error key ("checksumError") and message ("Checksums do not match") when validation fails. It follows Java Bean Validation standards with `groups` and `payload` parameters. The annotation is retained at runtime for reflection-based processing.
