This code defines a custom Java annotation `@MeetingNameConstraint` for validating meeting names. It ensures the name is not null, not empty, and between 2-256 characters. The annotation is applied to fields (`FIELD`) and checked at runtime (`RUNTIME`). Default error messages are provided for invalid cases. It serves as a constraint for input validation in API models, typically used with validation frameworks like Hibernate Validator.
