This code validates whether a user session token corresponds to an allowed guest in a meeting. It checks if: 1) the token is not null, 2) the session exists via `MeetingService`, and 3) the guest status is "ALLOW". If all conditions are met, it returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`. This serves as a validator for guest access control in a meeting system. (98 words)
