This code provides utility methods for constructing messages in JSON format. It defines constants for message components (version, name, header, etc.) and includes methods to: generate timestamps in milliseconds, build message headers with metadata (name, version, timestamp, optional reply-to), and construct a complete JSON message by combining header and payload using Google's Gson library. The output is a structured JSON string suitable for message exchange.
