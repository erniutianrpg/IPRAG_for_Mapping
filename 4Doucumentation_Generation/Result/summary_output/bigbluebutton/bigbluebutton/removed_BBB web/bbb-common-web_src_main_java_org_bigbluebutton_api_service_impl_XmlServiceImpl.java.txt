This code provides XML serialization/deserialization services for recording-related entities in a BigBlueButton system. It converts Java objects (Recordings, Metadata, PlaybackFormat, Thumbnails, etc.) into XML strings and vice versa. Key features include:

1. Converting collections of recordings or individual entities to XML
2. Constructing XML responses for API calls
3. Parsing XML back into Java objects
4. Handling pagination for recording lists
5. Generating "no recordings found" responses

The implementation uses DOM parsing and includes helper methods for XML document manipulation, field mapping, and type conversion.
