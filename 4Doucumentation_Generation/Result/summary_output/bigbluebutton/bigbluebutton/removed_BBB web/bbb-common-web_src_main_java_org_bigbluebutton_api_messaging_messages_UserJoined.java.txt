The `UserJoined` class is a message model representing a user joining a meeting. It stores user details like meeting ID, user ID, name, role, lock status, avatar URL, guest status, and client type. The class implements `IMessage` and initializes these fields through its constructor, making them publicly accessible as final (immutable) properties. This message is likely used in a messaging system to notify when a user joins a meeting in a BigBlueButton (an open-source webinar system) context.
