The `MeetingService` class is a core component of the BigBlueButton conferencing system that manages meetings and user sessions. Key functionalities include:

1. **Meeting Management**: Creates, starts, ends, and destroys meetings, including breakout rooms.
2. **User Management**: Handles user registration, joining/leaving, roles, permissions, and guest policies.
3. **Recording**: Manages recording status, processing, and metadata.
4. **Session Handling**: Tracks user sessions and authentication tokens.
5. **Cleanup**: Periodically purges inactive users and meetings.
6. **Webhooks**: Processes callbacks for meeting events.
7. **Presentation Handling**: Manages presentation uploads and downloads.
8. **Analytics**: Logs meeting and user activities.

The service acts as a central coordinator between various components like Redis storage, recording service, and the web API gateway. It processes messages asynchronously to handle meeting lifecycle events and user interactions.
