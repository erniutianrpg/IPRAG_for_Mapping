This code defines a `Stuns` request class for a BigBlueButton API. It handles STUN server requests with session token validation and meeting existence/status checks. Key features include:
1. Stores session token and meeting ID with constraints
2. Uses `SessionService` to validate sessions
3. Populates parameters from HTTP request (specifically sessionToken)
4. Validates user sessions and meeting status through annotations
5. Implements the `Request` interface for parameter handling

The class mainly focuses on request validation and parameter extraction for STUN-related operations.
