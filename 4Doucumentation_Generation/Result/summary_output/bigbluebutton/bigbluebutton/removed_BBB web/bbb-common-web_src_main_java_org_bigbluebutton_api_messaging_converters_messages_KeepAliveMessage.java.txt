The `KeepAliveMessage` class is a simple Java POJO (Plain Old Java Object) that represents a keep-alive message in a messaging system. It contains a constant for the message type (`KEEP_ALIVE_REQUEST`), a version string, and a `keepAliveId` field set via the constructor. This class is likely used to maintain connection health by periodically sending/receiving keep-alive messages between systems. (59 words)
