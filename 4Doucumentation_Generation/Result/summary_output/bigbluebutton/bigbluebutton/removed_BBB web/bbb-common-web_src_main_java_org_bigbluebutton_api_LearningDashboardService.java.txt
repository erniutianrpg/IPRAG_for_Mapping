The `LearningDashboardService` class manages JSON data files for a learning dashboard in BigBlueButton. It provides methods to:  
1. Create/get JSON files for meeting data (`getJsonDataFile`),  
2. Write meeting activity data to JSON files (`writeJsonDataFile`),  
3. Remove files after a delay (`removeJsonDataFile`), and  
4. Delete directories recursively (`deleteDirectory`).  
Files are stored in `/var/bigbluebutton/learning-dashboard` by default, organized by meeting ID and access token.
