The code defines a custom Java annotation `@UserSessionConstraint` for validating user session tokens. It ensures a session token is provided (via `@NotNull`) and valid (using `UserSessionValidator`). The annotation can be applied to fields, has runtime retention, and includes default error messages and keys for missing or invalid tokens. It follows JSR-380 validation standards with support for groups and payloads.
