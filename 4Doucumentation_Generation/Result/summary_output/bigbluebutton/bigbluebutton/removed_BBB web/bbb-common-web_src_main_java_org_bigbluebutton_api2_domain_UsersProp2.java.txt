The `UsersProp2` class is a data container for user-related properties in a meeting context. It stores configuration settings like guest policy, meeting layout, webcam restrictions, user limits, and camera capabilities. It also holds collections of users (both general and registered) and custom user data. The class is immutable (fields are final) and initialized via constructor, making it a simple value object for passing user-related meeting properties.
