The `RecordingService` interface defines methods for managing recordings in BigBlueButton, including text track validation, recording retrieval, state changes, metadata updates, and processing of downloadable presentations. It supports pagination, filtering by states/metadata, and provides utility methods for file/directory paths. The interface also includes a default method `listToPage` for converting lists to paginated results.
