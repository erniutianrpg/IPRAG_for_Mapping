The `CaptionTrack` class is a simple data container that represents a caption track with four immutable fields: `kind` (type of caption), `lang` (language), `source` (origin), and `href` (resource link). The constructor initializes these fields upon object creation. This class is likely used to store and pass caption metadata in a system. (47 words)
