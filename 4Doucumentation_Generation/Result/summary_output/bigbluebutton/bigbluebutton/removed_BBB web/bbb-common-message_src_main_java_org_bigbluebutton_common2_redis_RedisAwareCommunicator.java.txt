This code defines an abstract `RedisAwareCommunicator` class that provides core Redis connection management functionality for BigBlueButton. It handles Redis client setup, connection status events (connected/disconnected), and pool configuration. The class includes methods to set connection parameters (host, port, password), track connection state via event listeners, and configure connection pooling. Concrete implementations must define `start()` and `stop()` methods. The class serves as a base for Redis communication in the BigBlueButton system.
