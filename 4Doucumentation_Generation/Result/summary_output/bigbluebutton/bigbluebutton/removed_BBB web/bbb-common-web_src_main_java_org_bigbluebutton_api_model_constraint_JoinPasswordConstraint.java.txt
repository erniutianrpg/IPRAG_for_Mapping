This code defines a custom Java annotation `@JoinPasswordConstraint` for validating join passwords in a meeting system. The annotation is applied at the class level (`TYPE`) and uses `JoinPasswordValidator` to check if a provided password matches either a moderator or attendee password. If validation fails, it returns the default message. The annotation includes typical constraint attributes like `message`, `groups`, and `payload`, along with a custom `key` for error identification. It's part of a validation framework using Java's Bean Validation API. (98 words)
