The code defines a `ModeratorPassword` class that extends an abstract `Password` class, indicating it represents a moderator-specific password in a larger system (likely BigBlueButton). This simple inheritance suggests moderator passwords share the same base functionality as general passwords but are distinguished by type for role-based access control. The empty class body implies all behavior is inherited from the parent `Password` class.
