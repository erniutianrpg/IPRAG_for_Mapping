The code implements a scheduled task (`UserCleanupTimerTask`) that periodically purges inactive users from meetings in BigBlueButton. It uses a `ScheduledExecutorService` to run the cleanup task (`CleanupTask`) every 15 seconds (configurable) after an initial 60-second delay. The task delegates the actual user purging to a `MeetingService` instance. The scheduler can be started, stopped, and its interval adjusted.
