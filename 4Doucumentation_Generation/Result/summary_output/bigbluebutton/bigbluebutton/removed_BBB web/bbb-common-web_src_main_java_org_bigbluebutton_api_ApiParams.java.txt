This code defines a utility class `ApiParams` that contains constant string values representing various parameters used in the BigBlueButton API. These parameters configure meeting settings like recording options, passwords, layout, moderation controls, breakout rooms, lock settings, and callback URLs. The class serves as a centralized reference for API parameter names and prevents instantiation since it's a utility class.
