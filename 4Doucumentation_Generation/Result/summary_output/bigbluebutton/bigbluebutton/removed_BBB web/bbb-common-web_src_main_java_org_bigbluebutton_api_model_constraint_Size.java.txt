This code defines a custom Java annotation `@Size` for validation purposes. It specifies size constraints (minimum and maximum values) for fields or parameters, with default min=0 and max=Integer.MAX_VALUE. The annotation is processed by `SizeValidator` at runtime and can be repeated using `@SizeList`. It's usable on methods, fields, parameters, etc., and provides customizable error messages. This is typically used for input validation in APIs to ensure data meets size requirements.
