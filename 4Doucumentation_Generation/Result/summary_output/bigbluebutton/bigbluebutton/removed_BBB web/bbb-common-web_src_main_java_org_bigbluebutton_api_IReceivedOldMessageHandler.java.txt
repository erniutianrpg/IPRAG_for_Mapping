This code defines a Java interface `IReceivedOldMessageHandler` with a single method `handleMessage(IMessage msg)`. The interface is designed to handle received messages (of type `IMessage`) in a messaging system, likely part of the BigBlueButton API. Implementations of this interface will provide concrete logic to process incoming messages, but the interface itself only declares the handling capability without implementation details.
