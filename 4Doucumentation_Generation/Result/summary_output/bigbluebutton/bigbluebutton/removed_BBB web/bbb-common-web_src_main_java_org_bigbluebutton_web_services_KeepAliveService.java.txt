The `KeepAliveService` implements a heartbeat mechanism to monitor the connection between BigBlueButton web components. It periodically sends `KeepAlivePing` messages and expects `KeepAliveReply` responses. If no reply is received within 30 seconds, it marks the connection as down. The service uses threaded executors to manage message queues and scheduled tasks for sending pings and processing replies, ensuring system availability is tracked in real-time.
