This code defines a custom Java annotation `@GuestPolicyConstraint` for field validation. It uses `GuestPolicyValidator` to enforce validation logic, checking if a user is denied access (default message/key). The annotation is retained at runtime (`RUNTIME`) and can only be applied to fields (`FIELD`). It follows JSR-380 validation standards with configurable message, groups, and payload parameters.
