The `JsonResult` class is an `ActionResult` that formats API responses as JSON. It handles:
1. Wrapping output data (including messages) in JSON format
2. Setting HTTP status codes
3. Managing cookies (with secure flag for production)
4. Adding request IDs for tracing
5. Sending responses with proper JSON content type

The class provides constructors for different response types (success messages, error messages with status codes) and sends the response through the `HttpServletResponse` object.
