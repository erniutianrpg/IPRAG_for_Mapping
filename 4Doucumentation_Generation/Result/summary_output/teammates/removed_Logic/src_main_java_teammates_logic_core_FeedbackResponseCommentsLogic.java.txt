This code manages feedback response comments in a system, providing CRUD operations and visibility controls. It handles creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting comments, with methods to verify course/session validity and user permissions. The logic enforces visibility rules based on participant types (instructors, students, teams) and relationships (giver, recipient). It also includes methods to update comment attributes, emails, and sections, while checking if comments are visible to specific users based on their roles and team memberships. The class serves as an intermediary between storage and higher-level application logic for feedback response comments.
