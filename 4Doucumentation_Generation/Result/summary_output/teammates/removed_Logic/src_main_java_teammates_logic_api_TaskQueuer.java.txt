The `TaskQueuer` class is a utility for scheduling various types of asynchronous tasks in a queue. It provides methods to schedule feedback session reminders, published/unpublished notifications, course registration invites, email sending, and search indexing tasks. Depending on the environment (dev or production), it uses either a local queue service or Google Cloud Tasks. Tasks can be scheduled immediately or with a delay, and errors during email scheduling are logged. The class follows a singleton pattern for centralized task management.
