This Java enum `AuthType` defines four authentication levels for system access: `PUBLIC` (level 0), `LOGGED_IN` and `MASQUERADE` (both level 1), and `ALL_ACCESS` (level 2). Each type represents a different access privilege, with higher levels indicating greater permissions. The enum includes a constructor to set the access level and a method `getLevel()` to retrieve it. This is likely used for authorization checks in a web application. (98 words)
