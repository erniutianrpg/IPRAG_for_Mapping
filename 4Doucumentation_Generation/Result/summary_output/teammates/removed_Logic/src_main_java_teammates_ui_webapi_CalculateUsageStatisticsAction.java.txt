This code calculates and stores usage statistics for a Teammates application over a 60-minute period. It collects data on entities created (courses, students, instructors, etc.), emails sent, and submissions made within the time range. The statistics are built into a `UsageStatisticsAttributes` object and saved to the database. The action is restricted to admin users and returns a success message upon completion.
