The `DeleteStudentAction` class is a web API action that deletes a student from a course. It requires the user to be logged in as an instructor with permission to modify students (or as an admin). The action accepts either a student ID or email, retrieves the corresponding student, and deletes them from the course. If the student isn't found, it fails silently. Upon success, it returns a confirmation message.
