The `AccountRequestsLogic` class handles CRUD operations and search functionality for account requests in a system. It provides methods to create, update, delete, and retrieve account requests (by email/institute or registration key), count requests within a time range, and search across all requests. The class uses a singleton pattern and delegates database operations to `AccountRequestsDb`. It throws exceptions for invalid parameters, missing entities, or duplicate entries.
