This code is the entry point for a Java web application using Jetty as the embedded server. It:

1. Configures a Jetty server on a specified port
2. Sets up a web application context with the WAR file location
3. Optionally adds a development server login servlet if enabled
4. Implements lifecycle listeners for startup/shutdown logging and timezone info
5. Starts the server and keeps it running until shutdown

The application handles initialization, graceful shutdown, and provides basic logging during server lifecycle events.
