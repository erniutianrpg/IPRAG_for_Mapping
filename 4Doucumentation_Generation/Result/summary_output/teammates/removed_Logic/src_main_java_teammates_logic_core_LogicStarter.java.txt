The `LogicStarter` class initializes and sets up dependencies between various logic classes (like Accounts, Courses, Feedback, etc.) when the application starts. It implements `ServletContextListener` to trigger this initialization during web app startup via the `contextInitialized` method. Each logic class's dependencies are initialized through their respective `initLogicDependencies()` methods. The class logs a message upon successful initialization. The `contextDestroyed` method is empty as no cleanup is needed.
