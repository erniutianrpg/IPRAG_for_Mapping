The `UsageStatisticsLogic` class manages system usage statistics by:  
1. Retrieving statistics within a time range via `getUsageStatisticsForTimeRange()`.  
2. Calculating entity creation statistics (responses, courses, students, instructors, account requests) for a period via `calculateEntitiesStatisticsForTimeRange()`.  
3. Creating new statistics records via `createUsageStatistics()`, handling validation and duplicates.  
It uses singleton pattern and depends on other logic classes (Courses, Students, etc.) and a database layer (`UsageStatisticsDb`).
