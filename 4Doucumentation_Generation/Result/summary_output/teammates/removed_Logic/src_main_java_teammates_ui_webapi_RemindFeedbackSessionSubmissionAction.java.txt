This code defines an action to remind students about pending feedback submissions. It verifies the instructor's authority, checks if the feedback session is open, and schedules reminder emails for specified students. The reminders can optionally include a copy to the instructor. The action requires logged-in access and proper instructor permissions to modify the session. If successful, it returns a confirmation message.
