The `CoursesLogic` class manages course-related operations in a system (likely an educational platform). Key functionalities include:

1. **Course Management**: Creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting courses (including soft-delete to recycle bin).
2. **Instructor Handling**: Creating courses with associated instructors and managing instructor privileges.
3. **Student/Section/Team Operations**: Retrieving section names, team lists, and courses for specific students.
4. **Data Cascading**: Updates/deletes cascade to related entities (feedback sessions, students, instructors, etc.).
5. **Validation**: Checks for course existence and valid parameters before operations.

It interacts with other logic classes (Students, Instructors, Feedback) and the database layer (`CoursesDb`) while maintaining data integrity.
