This code is a worker action that sends published feedback session reminder emails. It takes a feedback session name and course ID as input, retrieves the session details, generates emails for participants, and schedules them for sending. It then updates the session's status to mark the emails as sent. If any errors occur, it logs them and returns a success/failure status. The action is restricted to admin users.
