The `OriginCheckFilter` is a servlet filter that validates HTTP request origins to prevent CSRF attacks. It checks: 1) allowed HTTP methods/headers in dev mode, 2) CSRF tokens for POST/PUT/DELETE requests, 3) App Engine queue headers, and 4) HTTP referrer validity. Requests failing these checks are denied with a 403 error. Valid requests proceed through the filter chain. The filter ensures requests originate from legitimate sources by comparing base URLs and verifying CSRF tokens against session IDs.
