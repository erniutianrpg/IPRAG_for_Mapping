This code defines a `GetUserCookieAction` class that retrieves and returns an encrypted user cookie value. It requires backdoor key access for authorization. When executed, it takes a user ID from the request, creates a `UserInfoCookie` object with it, converts it to compact JSON, encrypts the result, and returns it as a JSON response. The action is accessible to all users but enforces backdoor key access control.
