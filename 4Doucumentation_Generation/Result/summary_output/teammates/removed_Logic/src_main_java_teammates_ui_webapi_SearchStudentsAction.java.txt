The `SearchStudentsAction` class is a web API action that searches for students based on a search key. It allows only instructors (who can search within their courses) and admins (who can search system-wide) to access this functionality. The action processes the search request, retrieves matching students, formats the results with additional admin-specific details if applicable, and returns them as JSON. Unauthorized access attempts are blocked.
