This code handles the deletion of feedback response comments in a system. It checks access control based on user roles (student or instructor) and intent (submission or result viewing). For students, it verifies ownership and session openness. For instructors, it checks permissions to modify comments. After validation, it deletes the comment and returns a success message. The action ensures only authorized users can delete comments they own or have permission to modify.
