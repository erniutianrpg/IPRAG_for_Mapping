This code defines an API action (`UpdateInstructorAction`) that edits an instructor's details in a course. It verifies the requester's instructor privileges, validates the request parameters, and updates the instructor's information (name, email, role, visibility, etc.) in the database. The action handles both new and existing instructors, sanitizes inputs, and returns the updated instructor data. It also schedules search indexing for the updated instructor.
