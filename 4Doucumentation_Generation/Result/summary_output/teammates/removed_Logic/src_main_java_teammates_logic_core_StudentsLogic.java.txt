The `StudentsLogic` class manages student-related operations in a course management system. It handles creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting students, with cascading effects on related entities like feedback responses and deadline extensions. Key functionalities include student enrollment validation, team/section management, search operations, and bulk deletions. The class ensures data integrity by checking constraints (e.g., team/section validity) and synchronizing changes across dependent entities when student data is modified. It acts as a middle layer between the database (`StudentsDb`) and higher-level application logic.
