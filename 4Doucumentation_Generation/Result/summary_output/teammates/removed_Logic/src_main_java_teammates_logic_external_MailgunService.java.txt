This code implements an email sender service using Mailgun's API. It converts an `EmailWrapper` object into a multipart form request (`parseToEmail`) and sends it via Mailgun's REST API (`sendEmail`). The service authenticates using an API key, constructs the email with sender, recipient, subject, content, and optional BCC fields, and handles the response. If successful, it returns the HTTP status; if it fails during resource cleanup, it logs a warning and returns a success status with the error message.
