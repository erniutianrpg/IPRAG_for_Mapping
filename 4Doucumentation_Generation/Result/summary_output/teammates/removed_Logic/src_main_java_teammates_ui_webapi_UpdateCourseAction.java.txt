The `UpdateCourseAction` class is a web API endpoint that updates a course's details (name and timezone) in a system. It requires instructor-level authentication, verifies the instructor's permission to modify the course, validates the new timezone, and updates the course via business logic. If successful, it returns the updated course data; otherwise, it throws appropriate exceptions for invalid requests or non-existent courses. The code ensures proper authorization, validation, and error handling throughout the process.
