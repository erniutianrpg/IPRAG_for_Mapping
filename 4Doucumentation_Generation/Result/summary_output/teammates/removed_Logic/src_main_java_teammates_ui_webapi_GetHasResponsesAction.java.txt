This code checks whether responses exist for feedback sessions or questions in a course management system. For instructors, it verifies access and checks if there are responses for a specific question or course. For students, it checks if they have submitted responses for a feedback session (either a specific session or all sessions in a course). The code handles authentication, access control, and returns JSON results indicating whether responses exist.
