This code manages feedback sessions in a system, handling operations like creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of sessions. It includes functionality for publishing/unpublishing sessions, checking session attempts by students/instructors, sending automated emails for session events (opening/closing/publishing), and managing deadlines. The class also handles session visibility, submission tracking, and recycle bin operations (soft delete/restore). It integrates with other components like questions, responses, and comments through various logic classes.
