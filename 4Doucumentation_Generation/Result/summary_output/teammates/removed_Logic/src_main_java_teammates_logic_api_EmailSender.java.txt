The `EmailSender` class handles email sending operations in a Java application. It selects an appropriate email service (Sendgrid, Mailgun, Mailjet, or a dummy service for testing) based on configuration. The main method `sendEmail()` sends an email, checks for test accounts (skipping them), logs success/failure, and returns the sending status. It also tracks email details (recipient, subject, content) and status in logs. The class follows a singleton pattern with lazy initialization.
