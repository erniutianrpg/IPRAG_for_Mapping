The `NotificationsLogic` class handles CRUD operations for notifications in a system. It provides methods to:
- Get a notification by ID
- Get all notifications
- Get active notifications for specific users
- Create, update, and delete notifications
- Check if a notification exists

It acts as a middle layer between the application and database (`NotificationsDb`), handling exceptions like invalid parameters or missing entities. The class follows a singleton pattern with static initialization.
