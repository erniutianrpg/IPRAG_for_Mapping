This code implements a Google Cloud Tasks service to defer task execution. The `addDeferredTask` method creates and schedules a task to be executed after a specified delay (`countdownTime`). It constructs an HTTP POST request to a worker URL, either with URL parameters or a JSON request body, and adds it to a specified queue. The task can be scheduled immediately or deferred using Cloud Tasks' scheduling capability. Errors during client creation are logged. The service integrates with Google Cloud Tasks API for App Engine.
