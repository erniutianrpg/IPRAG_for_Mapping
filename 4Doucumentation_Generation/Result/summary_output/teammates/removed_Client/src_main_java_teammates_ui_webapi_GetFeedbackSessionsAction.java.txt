This code defines a `GetFeedbackSessionsAction` class that handles fetching feedback sessions for either students or instructors in a course management system. It performs access control checks, then retrieves sessions based on the requester's role (student/instructor) and optional course ID. For students, it filters visible sessions and hides sensitive information. For instructors, it includes session privileges. The response returns session data tailored to the requester's permissions.
