This Java script migrates database records of `FeedbackResponseComment` entities where `commentGiverType` is null. For each such comment, it sets the `commentGiverType` to `INSTRUCTORS` and `isCommentFromFeedbackParticipant` to false. The script includes preview mode functionality and only processes entities needing migration. It's part of a data cleanup task (issue #9083) to ensure all instructor comments have proper type designations.
