This code is a cron job that schedules feedback session closing reminder emails. It handles two types: (1) standard closing reminders for sessions ending soon, and (2) personalized reminders for users with deadline extensions. For each session, it generates emails, queues them for sending, and updates sent status. For extensions, it validates them against session deadlines before sending personalized reminders. The code ensures emails are only sent when enabled and deadlines are valid.
