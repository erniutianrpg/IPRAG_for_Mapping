This Java code demonstrates the step-by-step calculations for team evaluation results in a contribution question scenario. It uses the `TeamEvalResult` class to process different 2D arrays of input scores (including special values `NSB` and `NSU` for "Not Sure" cases) and prints the detailed calculation results. The `main` method tests four different input scenarios, showing how the evaluation algorithm handles normal scores, missing data, and edge cases. The output displays the computed team evaluations in a readable format.
