This code creates a new instructor account request in a system. It validates the request, checks for duplicates, and either creates a new request or uses an existing one if already present. If the instructor is already registered, it throws an error. Otherwise, it generates and sends a registration email with a join link. The action is restricted to admin users only. The response includes the join link for the new account.
