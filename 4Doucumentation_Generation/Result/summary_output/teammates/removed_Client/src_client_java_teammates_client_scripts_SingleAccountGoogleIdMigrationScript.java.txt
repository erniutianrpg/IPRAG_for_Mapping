This Java script migrates a single account's Google ID from one value (`fromAccountGoogleId`) to another (`toAccountGoogleId`) in a database. It checks if the account exists with the old ID, verifies if migration is needed, and updates it to the new ID. The script runs in preview mode by default (no changes made) and operates on a specific account filtered by the old Google ID. The main method triggers the migration process remotely.
