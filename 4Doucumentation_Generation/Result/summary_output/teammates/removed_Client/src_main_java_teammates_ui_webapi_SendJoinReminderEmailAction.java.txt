This code sends join reminder emails to students or instructors who haven't registered for a course. It checks the requester's authorization, verifies if the course exists, and determines whether to send reminders to a specific student/instructor or all unregistered students. The emails are queued for sending, and appropriate success messages are returned. The action requires the requester to be a logged-in instructor with proper permissions.
