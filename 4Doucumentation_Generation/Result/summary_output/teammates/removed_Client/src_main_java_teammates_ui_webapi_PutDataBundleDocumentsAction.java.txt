This code defines a `PutDataBundleDocumentsAction` class that handles adding searchable documents from a data bundle to a database. It requires admin access in development servers only. The action parses a JSON request body into a `DataBundle`, attempts to store the documents via `logic.putDocuments()`, and returns success or failure messages with appropriate HTTP status codes (200 for success, 502 for failure).
