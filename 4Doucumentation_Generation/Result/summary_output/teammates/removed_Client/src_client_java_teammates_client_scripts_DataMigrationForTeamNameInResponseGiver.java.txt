This Java script migrates giver names from student emails to team names in feedback responses for questions where the giver type is TEAMS. It targets old responses (pre-2015) by checking for null `createdAt` fields. For each affected question, it: 
1. Maps student emails to teams
2. Updates responses to use team names instead of emails
3. Handles duplicates by deleting them
4. Skips invalid responses (students not in course)

The migration ensures consistency by replacing individual student identifiers with team names in team-based feedback questions.
