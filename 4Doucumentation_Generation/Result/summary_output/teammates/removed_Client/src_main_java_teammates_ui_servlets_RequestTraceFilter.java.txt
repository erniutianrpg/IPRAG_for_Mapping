This servlet filter handles HTTP request tracing and security headers. It generates or extracts trace IDs for request tracking, sets security headers (HSTS, no-cache), and enforces timeout limits (60s for user requests, 595s for App Engine tasks). During maintenance, it returns 503 errors. It also validates UTF-8 parameters and handles bad requests. The filter helps monitor requests while ensuring security and proper error handling.
