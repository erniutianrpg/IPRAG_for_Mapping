This Java script migrates old feedback contribution questions by setting their `isZeroSum` field to `false`. It targets questions created before July 11, 2022 (V8.18.0 release) when the `isZeroSum` field was added. The script queries all contribution-type questions, checks if they need migration based on their timestamp, updates the field, and saves them. It runs in preview mode by default.
