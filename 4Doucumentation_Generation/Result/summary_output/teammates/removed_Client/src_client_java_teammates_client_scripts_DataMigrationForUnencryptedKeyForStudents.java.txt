This Java code migrates students' registration keys from unencrypted to encrypted format in a database. It checks each `CourseStudent` entity, and if the key isn't encrypted (fails decryption), it encrypts the key using `StringHelper.encrypt()`. The migration runs in preview mode (`isPreview() = true`), meaning it identifies needed changes without modifying data. The script operates remotely on all student entities via Objectify queries. Changes are deferred until explicitly saved.
