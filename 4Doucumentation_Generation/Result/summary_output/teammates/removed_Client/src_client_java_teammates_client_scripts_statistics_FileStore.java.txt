The `FileStore` class provides encrypted file storage for statistics data. It can:

1. Save a `StatisticsBundle` (containing institute stats and metadata) to encrypted JSON files using AES encryption
2. Load and decrypt stored statistics from files
3. Handle serialization/deserialization of `Instant` timestamps
4. Store data in a specified directory (`BASE_URI`)

The class uses Gson for JSON processing and Java's crypto API for encryption/decryption with a key from configuration. Metadata is stored unencrypted while institute stats are encrypted.
