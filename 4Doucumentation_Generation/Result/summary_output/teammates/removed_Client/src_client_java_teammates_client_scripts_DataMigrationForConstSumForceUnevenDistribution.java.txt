This Java script migrates FeedbackQuestion entities of type CONSTSUM where `forceUnevenDistribution` is true. It updates their `distributePointsFor` setting to "DISTRIBUTE_ALL_UNEVENLY" if currently set to "NONE". The script operates on Google Cloud Datastore entities through Objectify, with preview mode enabled (`isPreview()` returns true) to check migrations before executing them. The migration preserves other question details while updating only the distribution setting.
