This code updates a feedback response comment in a course management system. It handles three scenarios: student submissions, instructor submissions, and instructor results. For each, it verifies the user's access rights, checks if the session is open, validates the comment content, and updates the comment with new text, visibility settings, and editor info. The updated comment is then returned as JSON. Access control ensures only authorized users (comment givers, instructors with permissions) can modify comments.
