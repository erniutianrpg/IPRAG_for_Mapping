This code defines an `ArchiveCourseAction` class that handles changing the archive status of a course. It verifies the user's authentication and access rights, then processes a request to archive or unarchive a course. The action updates the course's archive status in the system and returns the new status. Errors like invalid parameters or non-existent entities are handled with appropriate responses. The endpoint requires a logged-in user with instructor privileges for the course.
