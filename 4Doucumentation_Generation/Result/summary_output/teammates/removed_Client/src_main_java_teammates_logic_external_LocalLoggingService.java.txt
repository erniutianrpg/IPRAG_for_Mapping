This code implements a local logging service for testing purposes in a Java application. It provides:

1. In-memory storage for feedback session logs
2. Loading of sample logs from a JSON file with randomized timestamps
3. Query functionality with filtering by various log attributes (severity, timestamp, trace ID, etc.)
4. Support for feedback session log creation and retrieval
5. Pagination for log queries (10 entries per page)

The service simulates cloud logging functionality locally, focusing primarily on feedback session logs for development/testing environments.
