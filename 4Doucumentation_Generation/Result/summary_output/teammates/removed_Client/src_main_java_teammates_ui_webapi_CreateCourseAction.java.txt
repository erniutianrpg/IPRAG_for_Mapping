This code defines a `CreateCourseAction` class that handles creating a new course for an instructor. It verifies the instructor's authentication and authorization, ensuring they have co-owner privileges at the specified institute. The action validates the course details (timezone, ID, name) and creates the course. If the course ID already exists or parameters are invalid, it throws appropriate exceptions. On success, it returns the new course's data and schedules the instructor for search indexing.
