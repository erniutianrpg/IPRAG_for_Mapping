The `StatisticsBundle` class tracks and manages usage statistics for educational institutes in an application. It stores unique student and instructor emails per institute, ignoring test data. Key functionalities include: adding emails to institutes, checking for test data, sorting institutes by student count, and retrieving unique email counts. Metadata includes statistics collection start time. The class uses nested `InstituteStats` (stores email counts) and `InstitutesStatsMetadata` (stores timestamp) for organization.
