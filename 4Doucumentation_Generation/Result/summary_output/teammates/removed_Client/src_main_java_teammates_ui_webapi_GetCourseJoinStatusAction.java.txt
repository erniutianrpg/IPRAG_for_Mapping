This code checks the join status of a user (student or instructor) in a course using a registration key. For students, it verifies if they're registered. For instructors, it checks either their account request status (if creating an account) or their registration status. The result indicates whether the user has joined the course. The endpoint requires the user to be logged in but has no additional access restrictions. It returns a `JoinStatus` JSON response with a boolean indicating the join status.
