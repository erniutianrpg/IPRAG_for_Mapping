This code handles API requests to retrieve feedback questions for a session in a course. It checks access permissions based on the requester's role (student/instructor) and intent (submission/results). Depending on the intent, it fetches relevant questions, populates necessary fields, filters out unmodifiable questions if needed, and hides sensitive information for students. The response includes normalized question numbers and question data tailored to the requester's access level.
