This code is a worker action that sends reminder emails for a feedback session to students and instructors who haven't submitted responses yet. It retrieves the session details, filters out participants who have already responded, generates reminder emails, and queues them for sending. The action is admin-only and handles errors by logging them. It returns a success message upon completion.
