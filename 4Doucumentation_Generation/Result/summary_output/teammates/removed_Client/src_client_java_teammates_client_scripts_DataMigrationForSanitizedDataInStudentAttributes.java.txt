This Java script checks and migrates `CourseStudent` entities by desanitizing sanitized HTML content in student attributes (comments and name). It logs errors for unsanitized fields (courseId, email, etc.) that shouldn't be sanitized, and only processes sanitized comments and names. The script runs in preview mode (`isPreview` returns true) and uses Objectify for datastore queries. It tracks scanned, affected, and updated entities. The main method triggers remote execution.
