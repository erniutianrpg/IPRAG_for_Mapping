The `LogoutServlet` handles user logout by invalidating the current session, adding a cookie to invalidate the login, and redirecting to the home page. It checks for a `frontendUrl` parameter to determine the redirect destination, defaulting to the base `/web` path if none is provided. The response status is set to 302 (temporarily moved) for the redirect.
