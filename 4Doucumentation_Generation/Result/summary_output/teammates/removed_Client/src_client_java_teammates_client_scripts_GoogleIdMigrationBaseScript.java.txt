This abstract Java class provides a base framework for migrating Google IDs in a database. It scans `Account` entities, checks if migration is needed via `isMigrationOfGoogleIdNeeded`, and generates new IDs via `generateNewGoogleId`. The script updates related `CourseStudent` and `Instructor` entities, recreates the `Account` with the new ID, and deletes the old one. Concrete implementations must define the migration criteria and new ID generation logic. The process is non-atomic due to Datastore constraints.
