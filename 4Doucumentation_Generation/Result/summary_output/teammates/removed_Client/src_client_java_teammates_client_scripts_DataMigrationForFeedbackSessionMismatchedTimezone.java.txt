This Java script migrates feedback session data to match their corresponding course's timezone. It identifies feedback sessions with mismatched timezones, calculates the time difference between the old and new timezones, and adjusts all session timestamps (start, end, visibility) accordingly. The changes are saved as deferred updates. The script runs in preview mode by default, showing what would be changed without actually modifying data.
