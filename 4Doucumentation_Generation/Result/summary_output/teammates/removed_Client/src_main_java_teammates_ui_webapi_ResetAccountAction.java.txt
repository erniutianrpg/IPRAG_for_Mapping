The `ResetAccountAction` class is an admin-only API endpoint that resets a student's or instructor's Google ID associated with their account in a specific course. It checks if the provided email exists, resets their Google ID, schedules a registration invite, and deletes the old account if it's no longer linked to any courses. Returns a success message upon completion.
