This Java script migrates Google IDs in Account entities by appending "@gmail.com" to IDs that don't contain "@". It extends a base migration class, checks if an account's Google ID needs migration (lacking "@"), and generates the new ID by adding "@gmail.com". The script runs in preview mode (doesn't modify data) and processes all Account entities. Main execution starts via `doOperationRemotely()`.
