This Java script creates a mock course with a large dataset for testing purposes. It generates:
1. A course with 500 students divided into 100 teams
2. 30 feedback questions
3. Feedback responses where each student responds to teammates
4. Instructor and student accounts
5. A feedback session

The script bundles this data, removes any existing test data, and persists the new dataset. It's designed to test systems handling large-scale course data, particularly feedback response volumes. The course ID is set to "TestData.500S30Q100T" for identification.
