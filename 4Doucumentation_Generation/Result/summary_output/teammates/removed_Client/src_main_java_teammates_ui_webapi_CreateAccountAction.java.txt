This code creates a new instructor account with sample demo courses. It validates a registration key, sets a default timezone if needed, and checks if the account request exists and is unused. It then imports demo data (courses, sessions) for the instructor, generates a unique course ID based on the instructor's email, and updates the account request status. The demo data includes adjusted timestamps based on the instructor's timezone. Finally, it schedules search indexing for students and instructors in the demo course.
