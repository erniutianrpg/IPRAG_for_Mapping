This code calculates and reports statistics about unique students and instructors per educational institute from a datastore. It processes data in 30-day increments, tracking emails associated with each institute via course entities. The script maintains checkpoints for incremental processing and outputs: 1) stats per institute (instructors + students), 2) unique student emails, and 3) unique instructor emails system-wide. Results are sorted by student count and saved between runs.
