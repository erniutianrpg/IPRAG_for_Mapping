This Java script migrates and desanitizes sanitized data in `Course` entities. It checks if a course's name contains sanitized HTML and, if so, desanitizes it. The script operates in preview mode (`isPreview` returns `true`), scanning and counting affected entities without making changes. It extends a base migration class, using Objectify for queries, and tracks scanned, affected, and updated entities via counters. The main method triggers remote execution.
