This code provides a base class for data migration scripts in a Google Datastore environment. Key features include:

1. Batch processing of entities (100 at a time) to prevent memory issues
2. Checkpointing via cursor position saving/loading for resuming failed migrations
3. Support for both transactional and non-transactional migrations
4. Preview mode to test migrations without modifying data
5. Logging and progress tracking
6. Helper methods for HTML sanitization/desanitization
7. Statistics tracking (scanned/affected/updated entities)

The abstract class requires implementing methods to define entity filtering, migration logic, and preview mode control. It handles the underlying migration process including cursor management, batch saving, and error handling.
