The `DatastoreClient` class provides a base for performing remote operations on a Google Cloud Datastore (local or production). It initializes the Objectify service for datastore access, sets up the connection (including handling dev server URLs), registers entity classes, and manages the operation lifecycle. Concrete implementations must define the specific operation in `doOperation()`. The class handles connection setup/teardown and dependency initialization automatically via `doOperationRemotely()`.
