This code is the entry point for a Java web application using Jetty as the embedded server. It:

1. Configures a Jetty server on a specified port
2. Sets up a web application context with the deployed WAR file
3. Optionally adds a development login servlet if running in dev mode
4. Implements lifecycle listeners for logging startup/shutdown events and failures
5. Starts the server and keeps it running until shutdown

The application handles initialization, serves web content, and provides development utilities while logging key events during its lifecycle.
