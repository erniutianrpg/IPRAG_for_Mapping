This code defines a `GetInstructorsAction` API endpoint that retrieves instructor details for a course. It checks access control: admins get full access, students see limited info (hidden fields), while instructors with proper privileges see complete details. The response varies based on the requester's role and the `intent` parameter (null for basic info, `FULL_DETAIL` for complete data). Sensitive fields like Google IDs are hidden from students. The endpoint returns instructor data in JSON format.
