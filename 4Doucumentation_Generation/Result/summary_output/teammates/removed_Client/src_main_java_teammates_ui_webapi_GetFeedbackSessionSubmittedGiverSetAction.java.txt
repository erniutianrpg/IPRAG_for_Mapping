This code defines an API action (`GetFeedbackSessionSubmittedGiverSetAction`) that retrieves a set of givers (users who submitted responses) for a specific feedback session in a course. It requires the user to be logged in and verifies instructor-level access. The action takes `courseId` and `feedbackSessionName` as input, checks permissions, and returns a `FeedbackSessionSubmittedGiverSet` containing all givers who responded to that session.
