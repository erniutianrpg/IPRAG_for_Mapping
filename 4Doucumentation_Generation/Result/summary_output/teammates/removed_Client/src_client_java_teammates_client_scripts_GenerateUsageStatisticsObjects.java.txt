This Java code generates random usage statistics data for testing purposes. It creates `NUM_OF_STATISTICS_OBJECTS` (744) `UsageStatisticsAttributes` objects, each representing hourly data for metrics like responses, courses, students, etc. with random values. The data spans 31 days (1 month) backward from the current time, with each entry timestamped hourly. The statistics are stored via a `Logic` class instance, handling potential exceptions for duplicates or invalid parameters.
