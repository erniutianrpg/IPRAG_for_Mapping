The `WebApiServlet` is a central HTTP servlet that handles all web requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) by routing them through `Action` classes via `ActionFactory`. It processes requests, executes corresponding actions, and handles various exceptions by returning appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages. It logs request details and errors, with special handling for App Engine queue requests to prevent retries on invalid requests. The servlet ensures proper access control and request validation while providing meaningful responses to clients.
