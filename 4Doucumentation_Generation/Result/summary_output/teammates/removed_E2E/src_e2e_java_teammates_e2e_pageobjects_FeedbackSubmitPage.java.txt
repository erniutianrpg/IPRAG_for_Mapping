This code defines a `FeedbackSubmitPage` class for automated testing of a feedback submission page in an educational platform. It provides methods to:
1. Verify session details and question counts
2. Validate different question types (text, MCQ, MSQ, numerical scale, constant sum, contribution, rubric, ranking)
3. Fill and verify responses for each question type
4. Handle comments and submission
5. Check visibility settings and warning messages

The class uses Selenium WebDriver to interact with page elements and verify their contents against expected values from various feedback question attributes.
