The `WebSecurityHeaderFilter` is a Java servlet filter that adds several security headers to HTTP responses. It sets Content-Security-Policy (CSP) with strict resource loading rules, X-Content-Type-Options to prevent MIME sniffing, X-Frame-Options to restrict framing, X-XSS-Protection for cross-site scripting protection, and Strict-Transport-Security for HTTPS enforcement. The CSP policy varies slightly between development and production environments, particularly for image sources. This enhances web application security by mitigating common vulnerabilities.
