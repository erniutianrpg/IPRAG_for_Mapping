This code defines a Selenium Page Object class for the instructor feedback edit page in a web application. Key functionalities include:

1. Managing feedback session details (editing, copying, deleting sessions)
2. Verifying and modifying session settings (time, visibility, email notifications)
3. Handling feedback questions (adding, editing, duplicating, deleting)
4. Supporting various question types (text, MCQ, MSQ, numerical scale, rubric, etc.)
5. Previewing feedback sessions as students/instructors
6. Validating question properties and configurations

The class provides methods to interact with all UI elements on the page and verify their states against expected values, serving as the test automation interface for the instructor feedback editing functionality.
