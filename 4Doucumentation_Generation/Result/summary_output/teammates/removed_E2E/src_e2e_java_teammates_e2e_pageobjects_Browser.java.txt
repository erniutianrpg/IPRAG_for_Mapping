The `Browser` class provides a programmatic interface for Selenium WebDriver to automate browser testing. It supports Chrome, Firefox, and Edge with customizable options like download paths, private browsing, and timeouts. Key functionalities include page navigation, window management, cookie handling, and waiting for page loads (including AJAX/animations). It also handles browser-specific configurations and timeouts gracefully. The class is designed for end-to-end testing of web applications.
