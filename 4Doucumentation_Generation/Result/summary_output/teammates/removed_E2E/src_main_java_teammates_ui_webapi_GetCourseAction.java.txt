The `GetCourseAction` class is a web API endpoint that retrieves course details for either an instructor or a student. It checks access control, ensuring only authorized users (admins, instructors, or students of the course) can access it. For instructors, it includes their privileges; for students, it hides sensitive information. The course data is returned as a JSON response. The endpoint is publicly accessible but enforces role-based permissions.
