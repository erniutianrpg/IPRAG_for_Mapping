This code implements end-to-end (E2E) tests for Constant Sum Option questions in a feedback system. It verifies functionality on both the instructor's question editing page and the student's submission page. The tests include:
1. Adding, copying, and editing questions with options and point distributions
2. Submitting and editing responses with different point allocations
3. Validating that questions and responses are correctly saved in the database
The test uses prepared test data and checks UI interactions against expected backend behavior.
