This code is an end-to-end test for a feedback results page in an educational platform. It verifies that:
1. Students (registered/unregistered) and instructors can access feedback session results
2. Questions, responses, statistics (numerical scale, rubric, contribution), and comments are correctly displayed
3. Visibility rules for responses/comments are enforced based on user roles
4. Preview functionality works for both student and instructor views
5. Proper identifiers ("You", team names) are shown where appropriate

The test checks various scenarios including different user types, visibility settings, and statistical calculations.
