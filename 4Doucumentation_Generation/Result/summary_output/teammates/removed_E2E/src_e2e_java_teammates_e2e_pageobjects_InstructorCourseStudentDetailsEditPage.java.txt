This code defines a page object class `InstructorCourseStudentDetailsEditPage` for testing an instructor's student details edit page. It locates and interacts with web elements (name, section, team, email, comments fields, and submit button) and provides methods to:
1. Verify the page and student details match expected values
2. Edit student details and submit changes
3. Edit a student's email and resend access links
The class extends a base `AppPage` for common browser interactions.
