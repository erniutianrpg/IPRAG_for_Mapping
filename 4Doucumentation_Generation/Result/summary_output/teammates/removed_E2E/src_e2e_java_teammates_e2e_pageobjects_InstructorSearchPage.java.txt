This code defines a page object class `InstructorSearchPage` for testing an instructor's student search functionality in a web application. It includes methods to:
1. Search for students using keywords
2. Verify student details against expected values
3. Delete, view, edit students, and view all records
4. Navigate to related pages (student details, edit, records)
5. Handle UI elements like search bars, buttons, and loading states

The class interacts with student and course data, validates UI components, and performs various instructor actions on student records.
