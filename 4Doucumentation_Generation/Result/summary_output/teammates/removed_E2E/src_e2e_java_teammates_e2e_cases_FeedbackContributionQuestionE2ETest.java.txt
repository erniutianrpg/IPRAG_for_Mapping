This code is an end-to-end test for feedback contribution questions in an educational platform. It verifies: 
1) Instructor functionality to add, copy, and edit contribution questions in a feedback session.
2) Student functionality to submit and edit responses to contribution questions, including special cases like equal share and "not sure" options.
3) Database persistence of questions and responses.

The test uses page objects to simulate user interactions and verifies UI elements match expected question/response details.
