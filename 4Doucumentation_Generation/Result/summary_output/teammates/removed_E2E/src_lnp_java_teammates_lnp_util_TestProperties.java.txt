The `TestProperties` class loads and stores configuration values from a `test.properties` file for L&P (Load & Performance) testing. It defines constants for file directories (test data, config, results) and reads properties like JMeter home path, application URL, domain, port, CSRF key, and backdoor key. The properties are loaded once during class initialization via a static block, throwing a runtime exception if the file is inaccessible. The class is non-instantiable (private constructor).
