This code is an end-to-end test for an instructor's course details page in a web application. It verifies various functionalities including:

1. Loading and displaying course, instructor, and student details
2. Viewing, editing, and accessing student records
3. Sending email invites to students
4. Downloading student lists
5. Deleting individual students or all students
6. Verifying status messages and database changes

The test uses test data from a JSON file and checks UI elements, navigation, email functionality, and file downloads while maintaining test isolation by cleaning up before execution.
