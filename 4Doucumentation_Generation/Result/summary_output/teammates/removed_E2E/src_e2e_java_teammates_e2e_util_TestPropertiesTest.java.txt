This code is a test class that verifies the presence of two configuration properties (`TEAMMATES_FRONTEND_URL` and `TEAMMATES_BACKEND_URL`) in the `TestProperties` class. It uses TestNG's `@Test` annotation to check that these properties are not null, ensuring they are properly set for testing purposes. The test extends a base test class (`BaseTestCase`) common in the codebase. In short, it validates that essential URLs for frontend and backend are configured in the test environment. (Word count: 72)
