This code is an end-to-end (E2E) test for Multiple Select Question (MSQ) functionality in a feedback system. It verifies: 
1. Instructor operations (edit, add, copy questions) on the feedback edit page
2. Student submission and editing of MSQ responses on the submission page
3. Database persistence of questions and responses
4. Validation of question details and generated options

The test uses prepared test data to simulate user interactions and checks if the UI and database behave as expected for MSQ-type feedback questions.
