The `SearchStudentsAction` class is a web API action that searches for students based on a search key. It allows only instructors and admins to access the functionality. Instructors can search students within their courses, while admins can search across the entire system. The results are returned as a list of `StudentData` objects, with admins receiving additional information like course institute and Google ID. The action handles errors and unauthorized access attempts appropriately.
