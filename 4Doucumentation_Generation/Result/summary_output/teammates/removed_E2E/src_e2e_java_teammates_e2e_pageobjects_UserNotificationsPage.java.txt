This code defines a Page Object Model for a user notifications page in a testing framework. It provides methods to verify displayed notifications, check their read/unread status, validate their content/style, and mark notifications as read. The class interacts with web elements like notification tabs, timezone displays, and buttons, performing assertions to ensure correct UI behavior based on notification attributes (title, message, style, timing). It handles both read and unread notifications differently, verifying their visual states and interactive elements.
