This code is an accessibility test for an admin sessions page in a web application. It prepares test data with feedback sessions having different time ranges (past, present, future) to ensure various session states are displayed. The test logs in as an admin, loads the sessions page, and uses Axe-core to analyze the page for accessibility violations, asserting that no violations are found. The test verifies the page's compliance with accessibility standards.
