This code handles retrieving feedback response comments in a web API. It checks user access rights (student or instructor) for a specific feedback response, verifies the response exists, and returns the associated comment if found. If no comment exists, it returns a 204 (No Content) status. The action supports both student and instructor intents, ensuring proper authorization before data retrieval.
