This code validates test data for E2E tests to ensure it doesn't resemble real user data. It checks JSON files in a test directory, verifying that Google IDs, course IDs, and email addresses follow specific patterns (e.g., emails must end with a test domain, IDs must match regex patterns). Invalid entries are collected and reported as errors. The validation prevents accidental use of production-like data in tests.
