This code defines a Java package (`teammates.e2e.util`) that contains infrastructure and helper utilities needed for running end-to-end (E2E) tests in the Teammates project. The package serves as a container for supporting components that facilitate E2E testing, though the specific utilities aren't shown in this snippet. In under 100 words, it provides the foundational tools required for comprehensive testing of the application's functionality from start to finish.
