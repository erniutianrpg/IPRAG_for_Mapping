This code defines an API action (`GetFeedbackSessionSubmittedGiverSetAction`) that retrieves a set of givers (users who submitted responses) for a specific feedback session in a course. It requires the user to be logged in and verifies instructor access to the session. The endpoint takes `courseId` and `feedbackSessionName` as parameters, queries the database for givers who responded, and returns them as a `FeedbackSessionSubmittedGiverSet` JSON response.
