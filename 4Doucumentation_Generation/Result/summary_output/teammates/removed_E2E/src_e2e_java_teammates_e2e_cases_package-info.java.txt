The code defines a Java package `teammates.e2e.cases` that contains end-to-end (E2E) test cases, as indicated by the package-level comment. E2E tests typically validate complete workflows or user scenarios by testing the application from start to finish in an environment that mimics real-world use. This package likely groups related test classes that verify system behavior across integrated components.
