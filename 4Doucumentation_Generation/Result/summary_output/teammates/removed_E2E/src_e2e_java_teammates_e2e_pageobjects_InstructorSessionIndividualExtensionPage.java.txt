This code defines a page object class for an instructor session individual extension page in a testing framework. It provides methods to:

1. Verify student/instructor deadline details against expected values
2. Select students/instructors (individually or all)
3. Extend deadlines by preset periods (12 hours, 1 day) or custom date/time
4. Delete deadlines
5. Handle confirmation modals and notifications

The class interacts with web elements like tables, checkboxes, and buttons to manage deadline extensions for feedback sessions, with validation of displayed data against backend attributes.
