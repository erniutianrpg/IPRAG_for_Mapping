This code is an end-to-end test for an admin notifications page. It verifies CRUD operations for notifications: loading existing notifications, adding a new one, editing it, and deleting it. The test checks if notifications appear correctly in the UI and database at each step. It uses test data from a JSON file and cleans up after execution. The test validates notification attributes like title, message, style, target user, and timestamps.
