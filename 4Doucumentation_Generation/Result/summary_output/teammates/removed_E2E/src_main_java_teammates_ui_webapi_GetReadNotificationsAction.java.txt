This code defines a `GetReadNotificationsAction` class that handles an API request to fetch read notifications for a logged-in user. It verifies the user is authenticated, allows any logged-in user access, retrieves the read notification IDs for the user from the database, and returns them as JSON output. The class extends a base `Action` class and implements methods for auth level, access control, and execution.
