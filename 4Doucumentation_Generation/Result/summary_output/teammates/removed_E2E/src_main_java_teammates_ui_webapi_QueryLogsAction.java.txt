This code defines a `QueryLogsAction` class that allows admin/maintainer users to query system logs with various filters (time range, severity, trace ID, etc.). It validates input parameters, constructs a query, processes logs through `logsProcessor`, and returns paginated results. For non-admin maintainers, it removes sensitive fields from log entries before returning them. The default query looks for logs within the last 24 hours with INFO severity or higher, with a default page size of 50 entries.
