This code is the entry point for a Java web application using Jetty server. It:

1. Configures a Jetty server on a specified port
2. Sets up a web application context with the deployed WAR file
3. Optionally adds a dev server login servlet if running in development mode
4. Implements lifecycle listeners for logging startup, shutdown, and failures
5. Starts the server and keeps it running until shutdown

The application handles initialization, serves web content, and provides logging throughout the server lifecycle.
