This code is an accessibility test for an admin search page in a web application. It uses Axe-core to check for accessibility violations. The test prepares test data (if enabled), logs in as an admin, performs a search with a student's email, and then analyzes the page for accessibility issues using Axe. It asserts that no violations are found. The test only runs if search tests are enabled in the configuration.
