The `JsonResult` class is a specialized `ActionResult` that formats API responses as JSON. It can:  
1. Wrap an `ApiOutput` object or simple message with HTTP status codes  
2. Add cookies to responses (secure in production)  
3. Send JSON responses with request IDs, proper content type, and compact JSON formatting  
4. Handle both success (200 OK) and error cases  

It's used as the standard REST API response format in the application.
