This code is an accessibility test for a student notifications page in a web application. It uses the Axe library to check for accessibility violations. The test:

1. Loads test data from a JSON file
2. Logs in as a student and navigates to the notifications page
3. Runs Axe accessibility analysis on the page
4. Asserts there are no violations
5. Cleans up by deleting test notifications after the test

The test ensures the student notifications page meets accessibility standards.
