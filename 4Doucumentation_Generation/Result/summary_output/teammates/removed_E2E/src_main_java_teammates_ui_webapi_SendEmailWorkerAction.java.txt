The `SendEmailWorkerAction` class is a worker task that sends queued emails. It validates an email request, sends the email via an `emailSender`, and returns a success message if sent successfully. If sending fails, it returns a `502 BAD_GATEWAY` status to trigger an automatic retry by the task queue. This is an admin-only action. (94 words)
