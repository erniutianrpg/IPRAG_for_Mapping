This code is a load and performance (LNP) test case for batch updating students in an instructor-led system. It simulates an instructor updating student enrollments in sections, generating test data for 1000 students across multiple sections. The test uses JMeter to measure performance metrics like error rate and response time, with thresholds set at 1% error rate and 60ms mean response time. It handles CSV and JSON data generation, HTTP requests, and cleanup after testing.
