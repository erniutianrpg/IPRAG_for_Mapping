The `AxeUtil` class is a utility for accessibility testing in Selenium. It disables specific accessibility rules (like color contrast and landmark checks) that aren't applicable due to framework limitations (Bootstrap, Handsontable, TinyMCE). It provides a preconfigured `AxeBuilder` for tests and a method (`formatViolations`) to format accessibility violations into a readable string listing each rule violation with its description, URL, target elements, and failure summary. The class is final and cannot be instantiated. (98 words)
