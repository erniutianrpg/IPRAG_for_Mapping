This code is an accessibility test for a feedback submission page in an educational platform. It uses the Axe library to check for WCAG violations. The test:

1. Loads test data from a JSON file
2. Navigates to the student feedback submission page
3. Logs in as a test student ("Alice")
4. Analyzes the page for accessibility violations using Axe
5. Asserts that no violations are found

The test ensures the feedback submission page meets accessibility standards for all users, including those with disabilities.
