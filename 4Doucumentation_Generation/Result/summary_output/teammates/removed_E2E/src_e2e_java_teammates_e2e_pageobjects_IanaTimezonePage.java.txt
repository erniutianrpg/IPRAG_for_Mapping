This code defines a Page Object Model (POM) class `IanaTimezonePage` for the IANA timezone database webpage. It uses Selenium's `@FindBy` annotations to locate two elements: the timezone version (`#version`) and release date (`#date`). The class provides methods `getVersion()` and `getReleaseDate()` to retrieve these values. It extends `AppPage` (a base page class) and implements a dummy `containsExpectedPageContents()` method that always returns true. The class serves as an abstraction layer for interacting with the IANA timezone page in automated tests. (98 words)
