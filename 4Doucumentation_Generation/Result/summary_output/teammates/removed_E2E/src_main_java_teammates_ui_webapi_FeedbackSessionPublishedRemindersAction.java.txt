This code is a cron job that schedules email notifications for published feedback sessions. It retrieves all feedback sessions requiring automated published emails, then queues each session's notification email to be sent. The action is restricted to admin users and returns a "Successful" message upon completion. It also checks remaining execution time during processing to prevent timeouts.
