This code defines a `BinFeedbackSessionAction` class that moves a feedback session to a recycle bin. It requires logged-in access and verifies the user has permission to modify the session. The action takes a course ID and feedback session name as input, moves the session to the recycle bin, and returns the recycled session's data. If the session doesn't exist, it throws an `EntityNotFoundException`.
