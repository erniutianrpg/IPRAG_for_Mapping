This code is a load and performance (LNP) test for a feedback question update API in an educational platform. It simulates multiple instructors updating feedback questions with associated responses (10 questions, 500 responses) while measuring error rates and response times. The test uses JMeter to create virtual users, handles authentication, sends update requests, and validates performance against thresholds (1% error rate limit, 1-second mean response time). It includes setup/teardown methods for test data management and generates CSV test data with course, instructor, student, session, question, and response details.
