The `BackDoor` class provides a utility for making direct API calls to the back-end during testing, bypassing the UI. It extends `AbstractBackDoor` and implements methods to retrieve configuration values like the app URL, backdoor key, and CSRF key from `TestProperties`. It follows the singleton pattern with a private constructor and a static `getInstance()` method to ensure a single instance is used throughout testing.
