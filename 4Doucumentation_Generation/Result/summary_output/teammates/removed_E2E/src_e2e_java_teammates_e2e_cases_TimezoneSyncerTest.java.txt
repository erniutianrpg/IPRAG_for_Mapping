This code verifies the consistency and freshness of timezone databases between frontend (moment-timezone) and backend (java.time). It checks that both have the same version, compares their timezone offsets, and ensures the version is up-to-date with IANA's latest release within a 120-day window. The test fails if versions mismatch or if the database is outdated, prompting maintainers to update according to the maintenance guide.
