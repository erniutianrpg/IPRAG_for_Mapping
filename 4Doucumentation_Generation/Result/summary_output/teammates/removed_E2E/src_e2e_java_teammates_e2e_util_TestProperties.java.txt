This code defines a `TestProperties` class that loads and stores configuration values from a `test.properties` file for end-to-end testing. It includes constants for test data/download folders, frontend/backend URLs, admin credentials, email settings, CSRF/backdoor keys, browser configurations (Chrome/Firefox/Edge), driver paths, timeouts, and test flags. The static initializer loads these properties from the file during class initialization. The class also provides a utility method `isDevServer()` to check if the frontend URL points to a localhost development server. All fields are public constants, and the class cannot be instantiated.
