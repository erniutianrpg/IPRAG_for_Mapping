This code defines a Selenium Page Object class for testing an instructor course edit page in a web application. It provides methods to:

1. Verify and edit course details (name, timezone, institute)
2. Manage instructors (add, edit, delete, copy, resend invites)
3. Verify and modify instructor privileges at course, section, and session levels
4. Handle custom permission sets for instructors
5. Validate UI elements and permissions

The class contains utility methods to interact with form fields, buttons, and privilege checkboxes, along with verification methods to check instructor details and permissions against expected values.
