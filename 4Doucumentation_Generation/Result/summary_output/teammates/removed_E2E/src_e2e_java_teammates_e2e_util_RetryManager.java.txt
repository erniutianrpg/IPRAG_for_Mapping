The `RetryManager` class handles retrying `Retryable` tasks with exponential backoff. It retries a task until it succeeds, exceeds the maximum retry delay (specified in seconds), or encounters a non-recognized exception. The `runUntilNoRecognizedException` method executes the task, catching specified exception types for retries, and throws `MaximumRetriesExceededException` if retries are exhausted. Retry delays double each attempt (1s, 2s, etc.) up to the maximum delay. Unrecognized exceptions are propagated immediately.
