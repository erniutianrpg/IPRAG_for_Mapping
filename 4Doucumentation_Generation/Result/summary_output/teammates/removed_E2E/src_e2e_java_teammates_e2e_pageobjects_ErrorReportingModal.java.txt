This code defines a Page Object Model for an error reporting modal in a web application. It checks if the modal contains the expected error header ("Uh oh! Something went wrong.") and verifies that the displayed error message matches the expected format ("The server returns the following error message: [message]"). The class extends `AppPage` and uses Selenium WebDriver for element interaction. (98 words)
