This code is an end-to-end test for a feedback system's Constant Sum Recipient question type. It verifies functionality on both the instructor's edit page (creating, copying, editing questions) and the student submission page (submitting and editing responses). The test checks if questions are properly loaded, added, copied, and edited, and validates that student responses are correctly submitted, displayed, and modified while ensuring data persistence in the database.
