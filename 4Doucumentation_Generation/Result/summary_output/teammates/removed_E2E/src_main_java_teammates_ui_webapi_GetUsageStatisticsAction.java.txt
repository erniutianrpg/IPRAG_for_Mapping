This code defines an API action (`GetUsageStatisticsAction`) that retrieves usage statistics within a specified time range. It validates: 1) user authentication (only admins/maintainers), 2) valid start/end timestamps, 3) proper time window (end > start, not exceeding current time, and within 6 months). If valid, it fetches statistics via `logic.getUsageStatisticsForTimeRange()` and returns them as JSON. The maximum allowed query range is 184 days (6 months).
