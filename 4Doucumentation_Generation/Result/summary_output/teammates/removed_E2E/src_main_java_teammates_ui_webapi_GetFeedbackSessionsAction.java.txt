This code handles a GET request to retrieve feedback sessions for either students or instructors in a course management system. For students, it returns visible sessions with student-specific data. For instructors, it includes sessions they can access, optionally including those in the recycle bin, along with their privileges. The code checks user authentication and access rights before processing the request, ensuring only authorized users can access the data. The response is formatted as a list of feedback sessions with appropriate permissions and visibility settings.
