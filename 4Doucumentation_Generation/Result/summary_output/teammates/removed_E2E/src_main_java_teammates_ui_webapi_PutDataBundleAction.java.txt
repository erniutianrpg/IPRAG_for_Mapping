The `PutDataBundleAction` class is an API endpoint that persists a data bundle into the database. It requires admin privileges and only works in development environments. The action accepts a JSON request body, converts it to a `DataBundle` object, saves it to the DB via `logic.persistDataBundle()`, and returns the persisted data as JSON. It handles invalid parameters by throwing an `InvalidHttpRequestBodyException`.
