This code defines a `GetNotificationAction` class that retrieves a notification by its ID. It's an admin-only action that takes a notification ID as a request parameter, fetches the corresponding notification from the database, and returns it as JSON. If the notification doesn't exist, it throws an `EntityNotFoundException`. The class extends `AdminOnlyAction`, ensuring only admins can access this endpoint.
