The `HomePage` class is a Page Object Model for a home page in a TEAMMATES application. It extends `AppPage` and provides two main functionalities:  
1. Checks if the page contains "TEAMMATES" in its title (`containsExpectedPageContents`).  
2. Overrides page load waiting to use document `readyState` instead of Angular testability due to a `setInterval` operation preventing Angular stabilization (`waitForPageToLoad`).  

It serves as a static page handler for end-to-end testing. (98 words)
