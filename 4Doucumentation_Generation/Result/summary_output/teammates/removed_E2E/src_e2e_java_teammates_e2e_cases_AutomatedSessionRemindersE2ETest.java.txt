This code is an end-to-end test for automated feedback session reminder emails in a learning management system. It tests five types of reminders: opening soon, opening, closing, closed, and published. The test prepares sample feedback sessions with specific timing conditions (e.g., closing tomorrow, opened yesterday) and uses backdoor requests to trigger the reminder cron jobs. The test emails are sent to a predefined test email address for manual verification. The test doesn't require browser interaction as it directly tests backend cron job functionality.
