The `ActionResult` abstract class represents the result of executing an action in a web API. It encapsulates an HTTP status code and provides an abstract method `send()` to forward the result to an HTTP response. The `getStatusCode()` method allows retrieving the status code. Concrete subclasses must implement `send()` to handle specific response packaging and forwarding logic. The class serves as a base for different types of action results in the web API framework.
