The `BackDoor` class provides utility methods for making direct API calls to the back-end without UI interaction. It extends `AbstractBackDoor` and implements methods to retrieve configuration values like the application URL (`TEAMMATES_URL`), backdoor key (`BACKDOOR_KEY`), and CSRF key (`CSRF_KEY`) from `TestProperties`. It follows the singleton pattern with a private constructor and a static `getInstance()` method to ensure a single instance. This enables secure, direct back-end access for testing purposes.
