This code is an end-to-end test for Rank Option questions in a feedback system. It verifies:

1. **Edit Page**: Tests loading, adding, copying, and editing Rank Option questions by instructors, checking UI and database persistence.

2. **Submit Page**: Tests student submission of Rank Option responses, including verifying loaded questions, submitting new responses, checking previous responses, and editing responses.

The test ensures proper functionality for both instructors managing Rank Option questions and students submitting responses, validating UI behavior and database operations.
