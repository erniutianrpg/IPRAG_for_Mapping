This code implements end-to-end (E2E) tests for an admin search page in a web application. It verifies functionalities like searching for students, instructors, and account requests by email; resetting Google IDs; regenerating registration keys; expanding/collapsing links; and managing account requests (reset/delete). The tests validate search results, link generation, and backend operations through a simulated admin interface. Test data is loaded from a JSON file, and tests are skipped if search tests are disabled in configuration.
