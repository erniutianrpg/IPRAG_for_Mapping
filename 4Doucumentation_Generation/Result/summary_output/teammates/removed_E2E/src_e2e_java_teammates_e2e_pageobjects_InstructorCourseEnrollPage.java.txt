This code defines a page object class `InstructorCourseEnrollPage` for testing an instructor's student enrollment interface. It provides methods to:
1. Verify page elements
2. Interact with enrollment spreadsheet (add rows, fill data)
3. Enroll students
4. Verify existing students and enrollment results
5. Handle various student enrollment scenarios (new, modified, error cases)

The class encapsulates all UI interactions for the enrollment page, including spreadsheet manipulation and results verification, using Selenium WebDriver.
