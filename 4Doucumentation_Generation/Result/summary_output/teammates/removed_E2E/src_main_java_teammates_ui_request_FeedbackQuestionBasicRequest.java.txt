This code defines a `FeedbackQuestionBasicRequest` class that handles requests for modifying feedback questions in an educational system. It includes fields for question details (number, brief, description), type, participant types (giver/recipient), feedback visibility settings, and validation logic. The class provides methods to validate input, convert visibility types to participant types, and get/set question properties. It also handles special cases like contribution questions and custom feedback recipient counts. The class serves as a data transfer object between the UI and backend for feedback question operations.
