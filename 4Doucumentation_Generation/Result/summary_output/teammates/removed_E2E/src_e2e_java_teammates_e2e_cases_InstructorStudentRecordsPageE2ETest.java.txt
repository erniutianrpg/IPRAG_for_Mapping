This code is an end-to-end (E2E) test for an instructor's student records page in a web application. It verifies that student details are correctly loaded and displayed by:  
1. Loading test data from a JSON file  
2. Logging in as an instructor  
3. Navigating to the student records page  
4. Validating the displayed student details match the test data  
The test focuses on one student's data from a specific course, with a placeholder for future feedback response tests.
