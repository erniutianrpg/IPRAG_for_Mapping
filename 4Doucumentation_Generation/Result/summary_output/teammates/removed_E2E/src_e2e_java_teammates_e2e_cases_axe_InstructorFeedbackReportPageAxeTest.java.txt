This code is an accessibility test for an instructor feedback report page in a web application. It uses the Axe library to analyze the page for accessibility violations. The test:

1. Loads test data from a JSON file
2. Navigates to the instructor feedback report page
3. Logs in as an instructor
4. Uses Axe to check for accessibility violations
5. Asserts that no violations are found

The test ensures the page meets accessibility standards (WCAG) for users with disabilities. It's part of end-to-end (E2E) testing for the application.
