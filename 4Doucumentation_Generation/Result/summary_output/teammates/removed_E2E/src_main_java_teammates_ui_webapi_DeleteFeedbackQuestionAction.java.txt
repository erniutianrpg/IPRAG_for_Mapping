The `DeleteFeedbackQuestionAction` class is a web API action that deletes a feedback question. It requires the user to be logged in and verifies they have instructor-level permissions to modify the session. After validating the question ID and access rights, it cascades the deletion (including responses) and returns a success message. The entire process involves authentication, authorization checks, and database operations.
