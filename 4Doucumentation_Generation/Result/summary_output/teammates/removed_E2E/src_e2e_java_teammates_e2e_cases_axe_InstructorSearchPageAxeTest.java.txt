This code is an accessibility test for an instructor search page in a web application. It uses Axe-core to check for accessibility violations. The test:  
1. Loads test data if search tests are enabled  
2. Navigates to the instructor search page  
3. Logs in as an instructor  
4. Performs a search for "student2"  
5. Analyzes the page for accessibility violations using Axe  
6. Asserts that no violations are found  

The test ensures the search page meets accessibility standards.
