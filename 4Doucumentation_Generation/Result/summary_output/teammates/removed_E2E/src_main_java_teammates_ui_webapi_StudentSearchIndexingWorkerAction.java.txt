This code is a worker action that indexes a student for search functionality. It takes a course ID and student email as input, retrieves the student's data, and attempts to index it. If indexing fails (throws `SearchServiceException`), it returns a 502 error to trigger an automatic retry. On success, it returns a success message. The action is restricted to admin users only.
