This code is an end-to-end test for an admin home page in a web application. It verifies:  
1. Adding instructors with valid/invalid details (checking success/error messages)  
2. Handling cases where instructors are already registered  
3. Resetting account requests for registered instructors  
The test uses a prepared data bundle, simulates admin actions through the UI, and verifies backend changes via a backdoor API.
