This code tests the instructor's view of student activity logs in an educational platform. It verifies: 
1. Default date/time settings for log filtering
2. Log output after a student submits feedback 
3. The instructor's ability to search and view session access/submission logs
The test simulates a student submitting feedback, then checks if the instructor can see this activity in the logs with proper filtering.
