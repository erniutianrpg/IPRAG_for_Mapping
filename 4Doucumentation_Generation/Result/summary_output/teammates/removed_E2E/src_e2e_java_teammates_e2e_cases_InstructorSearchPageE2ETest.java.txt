This code is an end-to-end test for an instructor search page in a web application. It verifies:
1. Search functionality (empty terms, no results, student searches)
2. Student details viewing/editing via page links
3. Student record viewing
4. Student deletion
The test checks UI interactions, result displays, and database operations using test data from a JSON file. It skips execution if search tests are disabled in configuration.
