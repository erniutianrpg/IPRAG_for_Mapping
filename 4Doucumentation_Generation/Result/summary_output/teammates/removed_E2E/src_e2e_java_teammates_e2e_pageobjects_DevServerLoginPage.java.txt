This code defines a `DevServerLoginPage` class for automated testing of a development server's login page. It uses Selenium WebDriver to locate the email input field and login button. The class provides methods to: 1) verify if the page contains expected content ("Not logged in" heading), and 2) log in a user by entering their email and clicking the login button. It extends a base `AppPage` class for common browser interactions. The class follows the Page Object Model pattern for UI test automation.
