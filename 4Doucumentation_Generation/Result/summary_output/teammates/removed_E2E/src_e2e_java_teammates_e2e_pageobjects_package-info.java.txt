This code defines a Java package (`teammates.e2e.pageobjects`) that contains abstractions of web pages for end-to-end testing. The package serves as a repository for Page Object Model (POM) classes, which represent web pages in the system under test (SUT) as seen in a browser. These classes abstract the page elements and interactions to facilitate automated testing. The comment indicates these are specifically for browser-based testing of the application. (Words: 58)
