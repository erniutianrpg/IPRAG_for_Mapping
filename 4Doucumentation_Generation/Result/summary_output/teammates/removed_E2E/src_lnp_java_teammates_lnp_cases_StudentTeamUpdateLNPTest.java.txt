This code is a load and performance (LNP) test case for a student team update API in a course management system. It simulates multiple instructors updating a student's team name (from "Team 1" to "Team 2") while measuring error rates and response times. The test creates test data including courses, instructors, students, feedback sessions/questions/responses, and uses JMeter to simulate concurrent requests. It validates that the API maintains an error rate below 1% and mean response time under 10ms under load.
