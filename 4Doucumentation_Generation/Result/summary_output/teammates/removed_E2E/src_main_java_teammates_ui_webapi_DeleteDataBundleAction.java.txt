This code defines a `DeleteDataBundleAction` class that handles deleting a data bundle from the database. It requires admin privileges and only works in development environments. The action accepts a JSON request body, converts it to a `DataBundle` object, removes it via the `logic` service, and returns a success message. Access is restricted to dev servers to prevent unauthorized deletions in production. (98 words)
