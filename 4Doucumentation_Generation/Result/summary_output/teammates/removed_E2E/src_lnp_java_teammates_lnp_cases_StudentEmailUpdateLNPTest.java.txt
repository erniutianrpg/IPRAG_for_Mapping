This code is a load and performance (LNP) test case for updating a student's email via an API. It simulates multiple instructors updating a student's email in a course with 500 feedback responses. The test checks if the system maintains an error rate below 1% and a mean response time under 10 seconds under load. It uses JMeter to simulate concurrent requests, generates test data (courses, instructors, students, feedback), and cleans up after testing.
