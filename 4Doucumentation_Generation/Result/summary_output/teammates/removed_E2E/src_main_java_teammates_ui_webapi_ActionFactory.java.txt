The `ActionFactory` class maps HTTP request URIs and methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to corresponding `Action` classes. It maintains a static mapping of URI-method pairs to action classes, initializing them in a static block. The factory provides a `getAction` method that, given a request URI and method, returns the appropriate `Action` instance or throws exceptions for invalid mappings. This enables dynamic routing of HTTP requests to specific handlers in a web application.
