This code defines a `InstructorHomePage` class for automated testing of an instructor's dashboard in a web application. It provides methods to verify course/session details, manage sessions (copy, publish, delete), send reminder emails, download results, and sort courses. The class interacts with web elements using Selenium to perform actions and assertions, ensuring the UI behaves as expected for instructors. Key functionalities include session management, response rate verification, and course archiving/deletion.
