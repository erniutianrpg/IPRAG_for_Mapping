This code is an accessibility test for an instructor course enrollment page in a web application. It uses the Axe library to analyze the page for accessibility violations. The test:

1. Loads test data from a JSON file
2. Navigates to the instructor course enrollment page
3. Logs in as a test instructor
4. Runs Axe accessibility checks on the page
5. Asserts there are no accessibility violations

The test ensures the enrollment page meets accessibility standards (less than 100 words).
