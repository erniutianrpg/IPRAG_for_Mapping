The `UsageStatistics` class is an entity that tracks system usage metrics over a specific time period. It stores counts for various user-facing activities like responses, courses, students, instructors, account requests, emails, and submissions. The entity includes a unique ID (generated from start time and period), start timestamp, and time period duration. It provides getter methods for all fields and is designed for persistence with Objectify (Google Datastore). The class represents aggregated usage statistics rather than system resource metrics.
