This code is an end-to-end test for an instructor's course enrollment page. It verifies:
1. Adding rows to an enrollment spreadsheet
2. Enrolling students into an empty course and verifying success
3. Modifying existing student data and attempting to enroll new students (including invalid cases)
4. Checking database entries and UI displays match expected results
The test uses sample student data and validates enrollment functionality, status messages, and data persistence.
