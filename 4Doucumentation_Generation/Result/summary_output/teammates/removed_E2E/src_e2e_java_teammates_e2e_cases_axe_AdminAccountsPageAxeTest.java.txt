This code is an accessibility test for an admin accounts page in a web application. It extends a base E2E test class, prepares test data, and checks the page for accessibility violations using Axe-core. The test logs in as an admin, navigates to the accounts page with a specific instructor ID parameter, analyzes the page for accessibility issues, and asserts that no violations are found. The test ensures the page meets accessibility standards. (98 words)
