This code defines an API action (`RemindFeedbackSessionResultAction`) that sends reminder emails to specified students about published feedback session results. It verifies the instructor's authentication and permission to modify the session, checks if the session is published, then queues email reminders for the selected students. The action returns a confirmation message upon success.
