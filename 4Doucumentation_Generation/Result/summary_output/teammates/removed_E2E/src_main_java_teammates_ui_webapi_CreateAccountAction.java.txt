This code creates a new instructor account with sample demo courses in a learning management system. It validates the registration key, sets a default timezone if needed, and checks if the account request exists and hasn't been used. It then generates a unique demo course ID based on the instructor's email, imports demo data with adjusted timestamps for the instructor's timezone, and updates the account request status. Finally, it schedules students and instructors for search indexing and returns a success message. The demo course ID generation handles duplicates by appending incrementing numbers.
