This code handles an API request to retrieve recipients for a feedback question in an educational platform. It checks access control based on whether the requester is a student or instructor, verifies permissions, and then fetches the appropriate recipients for the question. The response returns recipient data in a structured format. The action supports both student and instructor intents, ensuring only authorized users can access the recipient list.
