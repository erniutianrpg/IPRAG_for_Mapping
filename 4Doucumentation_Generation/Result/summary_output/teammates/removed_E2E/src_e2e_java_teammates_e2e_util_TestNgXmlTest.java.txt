This code verifies that all E2E test classes in the project are properly included in the TestNG configuration files (`testng-e2e.xml` and `testng-axe.xml`). It recursively scans the test directory, checks each Java test file, and ensures they're listed in the appropriate TestNG XML file. The test fails if any test class is missing from the configuration files. It handles both individual class inclusions and package-level inclusions in the TestNG configuration.
