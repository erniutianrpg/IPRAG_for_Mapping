This code creates a new feedback response comment in an educational platform. It handles three scenarios: student submissions, instructor submissions, and instructor results. For each, it validates access rights, checks if the session is open, verifies comment ownership, and ensures the comment text isn't empty. The comment is then created with relevant metadata (course ID, session name, visibility settings, etc.) and stored. The action returns the created comment as JSON. Access control varies based on user type (student/instructor) and intent (submission/result).
