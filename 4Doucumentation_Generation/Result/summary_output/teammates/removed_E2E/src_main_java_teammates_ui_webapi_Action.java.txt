The `Action` class is an abstract base class for handling HTTP requests in a web API. It provides core functionality for authentication, authorization, request parameter handling, and request body processing. Key features include:

1. Initializes user authentication info (regular, admin, or masqueraded users)
2. Performs access control checks based on user privileges
3. Provides helper methods to retrieve and validate request parameters and body
4. Handles both registered and unregistered students/instructors
5. Serves as a base for concrete action implementations to define specific authorization rules and execution logic

The class acts as a bridge between HTTP requests and backend logic, ensuring proper authorization before performing actions.
