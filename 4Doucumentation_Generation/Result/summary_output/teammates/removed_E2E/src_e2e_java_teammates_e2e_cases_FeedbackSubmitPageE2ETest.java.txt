This code is an end-to-end test for a feedback submission page in an educational platform. It verifies functionality for both students and instructors, including: loading session data, viewing questions, submitting responses (partial/full), handling closed/grace period sessions, adding/editing/deleting comments, previewing submissions, and moderator actions. The test checks proper rendering of questions, recipients, and submission restrictions while validating database persistence of responses and comments.
