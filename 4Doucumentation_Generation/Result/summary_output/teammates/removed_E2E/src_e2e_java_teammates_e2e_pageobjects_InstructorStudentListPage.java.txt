This code defines a Page Object Model for an instructor's student list page in a testing framework. It provides methods to interact with and verify UI elements, including:

1. Navigating course tabs
2. Verifying student details and course statistics
3. Deleting/viewing/editing students
4. Enrolling students
5. Checking permissions
6. Validating displayed data against expected values

The class encapsulates all UI interactions for the instructor student list page, making it easier to write and maintain tests. It inherits from a base `AppPage` class and uses Selenium WebDriver for browser automation.
