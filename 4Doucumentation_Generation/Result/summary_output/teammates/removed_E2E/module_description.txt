This module is a comprehensive educational platform management system with extensive testing infrastructure. It provides a full-stack solution for course administration, feedback management, and student/instructor interactions through a web API, while maintaining robust testing capabilities. The core functionality includes course creation and management, feedback session handling (creation, submission, analysis), student/instructor account management, and automated notifications. The system supports accessibility compliance through Axe-based tests and ensures performance via load testing (LNP). Key features include role-based access control, search functionality, timezone management, and extensive logging. The testing framework includes end-to-end browser tests, accessibility verification, and performance benchmarks, all supported by page object models and utility classes for test data management and retry mechanisms. The architecture separates concerns between UI, logic, and storage layers while maintaining security through filters and validation.
