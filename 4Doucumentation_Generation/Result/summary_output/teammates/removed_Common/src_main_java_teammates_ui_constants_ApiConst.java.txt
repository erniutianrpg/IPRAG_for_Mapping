The `ApiConst` enum defines constant values used by the back-end of a system (likely related to education/courses). It includes maximum length limits for various fields (course ID, student name, email, etc.) and special values for contribution points, numerical scales, and rankings. Each constant is mapped to an underlying value from `Const` or `FieldValidator` classes. The enum provides a `getValue()` method (annotated with `@JsonValue`) to expose these values, likely for API responses. This serves as a centralized location for backend constants. (98 words)
