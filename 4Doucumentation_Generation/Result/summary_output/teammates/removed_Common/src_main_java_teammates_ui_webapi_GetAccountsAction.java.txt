This code defines a `GetAccountsAction` class that retrieves all user accounts associated with a given email address. As an admin-only action, it sanitizes the input email, queries the database for matching accounts via `logic.getAccountsForEmail(email)`, and returns the results as JSON using `AccountsData`. The purpose is to allow administrators to look up accounts by email.
