The `EmailSentLogDetails` class extends `LogDetails` to store and manage email logging information. It includes fields for recipient, subject, content, type, status, and status message of sent emails, with getters and setters for each. The `hideSensitiveInformation()` method nullifies sensitive fields (recipient, subject, content) for privacy. This class specifically handles logs for `EMAIL_SENT` events.
