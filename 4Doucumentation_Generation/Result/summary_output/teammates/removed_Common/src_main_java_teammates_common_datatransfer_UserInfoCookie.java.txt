The `UserInfoCookie` class represents user credential information stored in cookies. It contains a user ID, verification code (generated from the user ID), and expiry time. The class provides methods to: create a cookie from a user ID, decrypt and parse a cookie string into a `UserInfoCookie` object, and validate the cookie's signature and expiry time. The cookie is valid if the verification code matches the user ID and hasn't expired. Helper methods get/set these fields.
