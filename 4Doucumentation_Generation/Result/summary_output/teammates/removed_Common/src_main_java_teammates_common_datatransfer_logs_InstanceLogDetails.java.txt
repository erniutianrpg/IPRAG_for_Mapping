The `InstanceLogDetails` class extends `LogDetails` to store and manage instance-specific log data. It includes fields for `instanceId` and `instanceEvent`, with getter and setter methods for each. The constructor sets the log event type to `INSTANCE_LOG`. The `hideSensitiveInformation()` method is overridden but does nothing, indicating no sensitive data needs hiding. This class is used for structured logging of instance-related events. (94 words)
