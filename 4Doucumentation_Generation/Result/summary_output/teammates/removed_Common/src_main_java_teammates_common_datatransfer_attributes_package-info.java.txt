This code defines a Java package named `teammates.common.datatransfer.attributes` that serves as a container for attribute classes. These classes act as wrappers for persistable entities, likely providing a structured way to handle data transfer objects (DTOs) within the application. The package is part of a larger system (possibly an educational platform called "Teammates") for managing entity data in a more abstracted or transferable format.
