This code implements an API endpoint to retrieve feedback session details in a course management system. It handles different access levels (student/instructor) and intents (submission/viewing results). The endpoint checks authorization based on the user's role and intent, then returns appropriate feedback session data with potentially hidden information depending on the user's permissions. Students and instructors get tailored views, while full details are only available to authorized instructors.
