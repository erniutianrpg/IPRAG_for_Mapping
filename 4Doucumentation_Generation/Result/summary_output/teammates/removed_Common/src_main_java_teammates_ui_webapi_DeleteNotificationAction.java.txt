This code defines a `DeleteNotificationAction` class that handles HTTP requests to delete a notification by its ID. As an admin-only action, it first retrieves the notification ID from the request parameters, then uses the `logic` layer to delete the corresponding notification. Finally, it returns a JSON response confirming the deletion. The entire functionality is concise: admin requests delete a notification by ID, and the system removes it. (75 words)
