This code updates a notification banner in a system. It takes a notification ID and update request (including start/end times, style, target user, title, and message) as input. The action validates the request, builds update options, and attempts to update the notification via a logic layer. If successful, it returns the updated notification data; otherwise, it throws exceptions for invalid parameters or non-existent entities. Only admin users can perform this action.
