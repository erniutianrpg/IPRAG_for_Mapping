The `InstructorPrivileges` class manages and stores instructor permissions at three levels: course-wide, section-specific, and session-specific. It defines default privilege sets for common roles (Co-owner, Manager, Observer, Tutor, Custom) and provides methods to update, validate, and check privileges. The class also handles conversion between legacy and current privilege formats and ensures proper privilege hierarchy (e.g., modifying session comments requires view access). Privileges can be checked at any level, with section/session privileges inheriting from higher levels when not explicitly set.
