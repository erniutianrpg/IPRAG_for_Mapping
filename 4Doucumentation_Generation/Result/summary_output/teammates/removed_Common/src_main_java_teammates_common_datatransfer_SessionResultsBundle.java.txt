The `SessionResultsBundle` class aggregates and organizes feedback session data, including questions, responses, comments, and visibility settings. It maps questions to their responses, tracks missing responses, and manages visibility of givers/recipients for both responses and comments. The class also provides utility methods to check participant visibility and generate anonymous names for feedback participants. Essentially, it serves as a container for all data needed to display detailed feedback session results while handling privacy/anonymity concerns.
