The `AuthException` class is a custom exception in Java that extends the base `Exception` class. It is specifically thrown when errors occur during authentication-related operations. The exception accepts a `Throwable` cause as a parameter, allowing it to wrap and propagate the underlying error that triggered the authentication failure. This helps in error handling and debugging by preserving the original exception context.
