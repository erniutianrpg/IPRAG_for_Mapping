This Java class `FeedbackMcqResponseDetails` extends `FeedbackResponseDetails` to handle multiple-choice question (MCQ) feedback responses. It stores the selected answer (`answer`), a flag indicating if "Other" was chosen (`isOther`), and the content of the "Other" field if applicable (`otherFieldContent`). The `getAnswerString()` method returns either the selected answer or the "Other" field content. It includes getters and setters for all fields. The class initializes with empty/default values and is specific to MCQ-type feedback questions.
