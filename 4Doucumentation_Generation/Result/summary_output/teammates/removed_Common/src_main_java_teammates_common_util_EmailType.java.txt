The `EmailType` enum defines different email purposes for a system (likely TEAMMATES), each with a specific subject template. It includes email types for feedback session notifications (opening, reminders, closing), deadline extensions, account-related emails (registration, login, password reset), and system alerts. Each enum value stores a subject line with placeholders for dynamic content. The `getSubject()` method returns the predefined subject template for each email type. This enum centralizes email subject formats for consistent communication.
