This code resets an account request for an instructor by clearing their registration timestamp, effectively allowing them to register again. It checks if the account request exists and is already registered, updates the request to unregistered status, generates a new join link, and sends it via email. The action is restricted to admin users only. If errors occur (e.g., invalid parameters or missing entity), it returns appropriate HTTP status codes.
