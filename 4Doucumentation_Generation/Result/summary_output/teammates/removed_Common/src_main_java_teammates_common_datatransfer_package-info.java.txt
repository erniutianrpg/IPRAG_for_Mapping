This code defines a Java package `teammates.common.datatransfer` that contains lightweight Data Transfer Objects (DTOs). These DTOs are used to transfer data between different software components, especially those in separate packages, while maintaining loose coupling and efficient data exchange. The package serves as a common interface for data communication across the application's modular boundaries.
