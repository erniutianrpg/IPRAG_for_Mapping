The `GetCourseAction` class is a web API endpoint that retrieves course details for either an instructor or a student. It checks access control, ensuring only authorized users (admin, instructor, or student of the course) can access the data. For instructors, it includes their privileges; for students, it hides sensitive information. The course data is returned as a JSON response. Unauthorized access or non-existent courses trigger appropriate error responses.
