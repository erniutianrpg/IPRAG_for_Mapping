The `AppUrl` class extends `Url` to handle application-specific URLs. It ensures URLs start with "http" or "https" and provides chainable methods to add parameters like user ID, registration key, course ID, session name, student email, and entity type to the URL. Each method appends a key-value pair as a query parameter.
