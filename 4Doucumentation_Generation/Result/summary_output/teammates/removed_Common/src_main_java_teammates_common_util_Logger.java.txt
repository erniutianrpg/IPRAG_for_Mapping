The `Logger` class provides a centralized logging utility for a Java application, supporting different log levels (FINE, INFO, WARNING, SEVERE) and specialized logging for HTTP requests, instance events (startup/shutdown), and exceptions. It formats logs differently for development (human-readable) and production (structured JSON for cloud logging) environments. The class also captures stack traces, request details, and source locations, and integrates with request tracing for distributed systems.
