This code defines an API action `GetSessionResponseStatsAction` that retrieves submission statistics for a feedback session. It checks if the user is authorized (admin or instructor for the course), then fetches the expected and actual submission counts for the specified feedback session. The response includes these counts in a `FeedbackSessionStatsData` object. Access is restricted to logged-in users with appropriate course permissions.
