The `TimeHelper` class provides utility methods for time-related operations in UTC timezone. Key functionalities include:  
- Getting the nearest hour before a given `Instant`  
- Creating `Instant` objects offset by days/hours from now  
- Formatting `Instant` objects to strings with timezone handling (including special noon formatting)  
- Adjusting midnight times in specific timezones  
- Parsing ISO 8601 datetime strings to `Instant` objects  
- Checking for special time representations (like "NOW" or "LATER")  

All methods assume UTC timezone unless specified otherwise. The class is stateless with only static methods.
