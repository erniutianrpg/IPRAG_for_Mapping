The `EmailWrapper` class represents an email message with its metadata, including sender/recipient details, subject, content, and type. It provides getter/setter methods for all fields and a special method `setSubjectFromType` that formats the subject based on the email type and optional parameters, adding a copy prefix when applicable. This class serves as a container for email data in a structured format.
