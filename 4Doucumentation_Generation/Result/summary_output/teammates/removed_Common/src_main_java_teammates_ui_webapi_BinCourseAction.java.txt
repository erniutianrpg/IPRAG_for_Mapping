This code defines a `BinCourseAction` class that moves a course to the recycle bin. It checks if the user is an authorized instructor, verifies access control, and then moves the specified course to the recycle bin by setting its `deletedAt` attribute. The action returns the course data as JSON. If the course doesn't exist, it throws an `EntityNotFoundException`.
