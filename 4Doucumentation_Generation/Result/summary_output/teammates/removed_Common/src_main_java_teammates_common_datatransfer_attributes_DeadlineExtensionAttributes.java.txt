The `DeadlineExtensionAttributes` class is a data transfer object (DTO) representing deadline extensions for feedback sessions in a course. It stores attributes like course ID, session name, user email, instructor status, deadline end time, and email notification status. The class provides methods for validation, conversion to/from entity objects, sanitization, updates via builder pattern, and equality checks. It serves as an intermediary between application logic and database storage for deadline extension entities.
