This code defines a `GetReadNotificationsAction` class that handles an API request to fetch read notifications for a logged-in user. It checks that the user is authenticated, allows any logged-in user access, retrieves the read notification IDs for the user from a logic layer, and returns them as JSON output. The class extends a base `Action` class and implements necessary methods for authorization and execution.
