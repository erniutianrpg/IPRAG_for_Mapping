This code handles feedback responses for ranking recipients in a survey system. The `FeedbackRankRecipientsResponseDetails` class stores a rank (answer) for a recipient. The key method `getUpdateOptionsForRankRecipientQuestions` ensures consistency in ranking responses by adjusting ranks that exceed the maximum allowed, shifting them down to fill gaps while maintaining relative order. It returns update options for any modified responses. The class also provides basic getters/setters for the rank value and a string representation of the answer.
