This code is a worker action that sends a course registration email to a student. It checks if the course and student exist, then generates either a join email or a rejoin email (if the student is rejoining after a Google ID reset) and sends it. The action returns "Successful" upon completion. It's part of a system where only admins can trigger this operation.
