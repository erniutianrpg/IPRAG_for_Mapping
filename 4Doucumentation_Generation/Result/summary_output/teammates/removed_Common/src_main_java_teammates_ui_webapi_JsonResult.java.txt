The `JsonResult` class is a REST API action result that formats responses as JSON. It can:
1. Wrap API output data or simple messages
2. Set HTTP status codes (default 200 OK)
3. Add cookies to responses (secured in production)
4. Include request IDs for tracing
5. Send compact JSON responses with proper content type

It's used as a standard JSON response format for REST API endpoints, handling both successful responses and error messages.
