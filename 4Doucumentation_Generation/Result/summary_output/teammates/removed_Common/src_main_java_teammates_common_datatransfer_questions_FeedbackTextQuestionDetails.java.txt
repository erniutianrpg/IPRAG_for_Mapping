This code defines a `FeedbackTextQuestionDetails` class for handling text-based feedback questions. It includes properties for recommended answer length and rich text support, with validation to ensure recommended length is at least 1. It checks if changes require response deletion (e.g., when disabling rich text) and provides methods for question and response validation. The class inherits from `FeedbackQuestionDetails` and supports basic text question functionalities.
