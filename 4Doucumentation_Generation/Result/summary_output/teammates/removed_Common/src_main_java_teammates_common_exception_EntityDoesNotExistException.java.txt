The `EntityDoesNotExistException` is a custom exception class that signals an attempt to operate on a non-existent entity. It extends Java's `Exception` class and provides a constructor to set a descriptive error message. This exception is typically thrown when code tries to access or manipulate an entity (like a database record) that cannot be found.
