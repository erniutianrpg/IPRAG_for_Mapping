This abstract class `FeedbackResponseDetails` serves as a base for different feedback question response types. It provides common functionality like:
1. Storing the question type
2. Generating string representations of responses (abstract `getAnswerString()`)
3. Converting responses to JSON (with special handling for text questions)
4. Creating deep copies of response details
5. Getter/setter for question type

Concrete subclasses implement question-type-specific behavior, particularly for `getAnswerString()`. The class handles JSON serialization/deserialization for copying responses.
