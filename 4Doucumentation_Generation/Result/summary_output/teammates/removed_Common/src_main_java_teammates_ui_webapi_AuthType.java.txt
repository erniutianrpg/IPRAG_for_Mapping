This Java enum `AuthType` defines four authentication levels for system access: `PUBLIC` (level 0), `LOGGED_IN` and `MASQUERADE` (both level 1), and `ALL_ACCESS` (level 2). Each type has an associated integer level indicating its access privilege, with higher numbers representing greater access. The enum provides a method `getLevel()` to retrieve the level value. This is likely used for authorization checks in a web API. (98 words)
