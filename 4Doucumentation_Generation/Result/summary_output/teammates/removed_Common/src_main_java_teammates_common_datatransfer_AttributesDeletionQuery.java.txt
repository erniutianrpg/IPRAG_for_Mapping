The `AttributesDeletionQuery` class is a builder-pattern implementation for constructing queries to delete specific attributes in a system. It allows setting optional fields like `courseId`, `feedbackSessionName`, `questionId`, `responseId`, `userEmail`, and `isInstructor`, with validation to ensure only valid combinations of fields are set. The builder enforces constraints (e.g., `feedbackSessionName` requires `courseId`) and ensures at least one field is set before building the query. Getters and presence-check methods are provided for all fields.
