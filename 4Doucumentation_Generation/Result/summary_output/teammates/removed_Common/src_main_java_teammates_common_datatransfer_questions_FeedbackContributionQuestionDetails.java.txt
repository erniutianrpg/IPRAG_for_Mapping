This code handles team contribution feedback questions in an educational platform. It processes responses to calculate individual and team contribution statistics, validates question settings and responses, and enforces specific visibility rules. Key features include zero-sum validation (where points must sum to a fixed total), "not sure" response options, and generation of statistical results showing claimed vs perceived contributions for each student. The code also ensures proper giver/recipient configurations and visibility settings for this question type.
