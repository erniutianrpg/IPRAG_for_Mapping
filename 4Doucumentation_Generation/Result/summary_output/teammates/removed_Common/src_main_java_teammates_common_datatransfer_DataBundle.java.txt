The `DataBundle` class is a container for various attribute objects (like accounts, courses, feedback sessions, etc.) used in the Teammates system. It holds them in `LinkedHashMap` collections keyed by strings, primarily for JSON serialization purposes. The class serves as a structured way to group and transfer multiple related data entities together.
