The `Config` class loads and manages deployment-specific configuration values from `build.properties` and `build-dev.properties` files. It provides static constants for various application settings like app ID, version, authentication keys, email services, and environment-specific configurations (dev vs production). The class automatically detects the runtime environment and loads appropriate properties, with dev server settings taking precedence in development mode. It also includes utility methods to check active services (Firebase, SendGrid, etc.) and construct application URLs.
