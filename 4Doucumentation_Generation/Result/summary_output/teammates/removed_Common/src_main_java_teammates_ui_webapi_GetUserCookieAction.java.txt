The `GetUserCookieAction` class is a backend API action that returns an encrypted user cookie value. It requires a backdoor key for access (no standard authentication). When executed with a provided user ID, it creates a `UserInfoCookie`, converts it to a compact JSON string, encrypts it, and returns the result. The action is restricted to internal/backdoor use only. (98 words)
