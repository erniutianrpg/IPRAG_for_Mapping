This code checks whether responses exist for feedback sessions or questions in a course management system. For instructors, it verifies if there are responses for a specific question or course. For students, it checks if they have submitted responses for a feedback session. The code handles access control, ensuring only authorized users (instructors of the course or the student themselves) can check these responses, and returns a JSON result indicating whether responses exist.
