This code retrieves all ongoing feedback sessions within a specified time range for admin purposes. It validates the time parameters, counts sessions by status (open/closed/awaiting), organizes them by course and institution, and returns statistics including total sessions and institutions. The output includes session details mapped to institutions, with instructor account information where available.
