This code is a cron job that compiles application logs with severity level `ERROR` from the past 6 minutes and sends them to a support email. It queries logs within the specified time range, filters for errors, converts them to `ErrorLogEntry` objects, and emails them if any errors are found. If no errors are detected, no email is sent to avoid spamming. The action returns a "Successful" status upon completion.
