The `ExceptionLogDetails` class extends `LogDetails` to store and manage exception-related logging information. It includes fields for exception class(es), stack traces, messages (nullable), and source location. The class provides getters/setters for these fields and overrides `hideSensitiveInformation()` to nullify sensitive data (messages and parent message). It's specifically used for `EXCEPTION_LOG` events.
