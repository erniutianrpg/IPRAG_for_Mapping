This code defines an enum `NotificationStyle` that represents different background colors for notification banners, corresponding to Bootstrap's color utility classes. The available styles are: PRIMARY (blue), SECONDARY (grey), SUCCESS (green), DANGER (red), WARNING (orange), INFO (cyan), LIGHT (white), and DARK (black). Each enum value corresponds to a specific background color option.
