Key methods include `getBaseUrl()` to retrieve the base URL, `withParam()` to add sanitized query parameters, and `toAbsoluteString()` to combine base and relative URLs. The class also includes helper methods like `addParamToUrl()` for safe parameter addition and validation. Overall, it provides utilities for URL construction and modification. (98 words)
