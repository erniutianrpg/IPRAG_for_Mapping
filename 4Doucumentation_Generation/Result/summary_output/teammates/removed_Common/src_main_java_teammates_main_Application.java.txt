This code is the entry point for a Java web application using Jetty as the embedded server. It:

1. Configures a Jetty server on a specified port
2. Sets up a web application context with the WAR file path
3. Optionally adds a development login servlet if running in dev mode
4. Implements lifecycle listeners for logging startup/shutdown events and failures
5. Starts the server and keeps it running until shutdown

The application handles initialization, provides logging during server lifecycle events, and supports development-specific features when enabled.
