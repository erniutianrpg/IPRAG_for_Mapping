This Java enum defines different types of feedback questions in a system, associating each question type (e.g., TEXT, MCQ, RUBRIC) with its corresponding question details and response details classes. It provides methods to access these classes, enabling the system to handle various feedback question formats uniformly. The enum includes branched versions (e.g., CONSTSUM_OPTIONS) for front-end rendering convenience while maintaining back-end simplicity.
