The `Templates` class provides utility methods for string template processing. Its main functionality includes:

1. Reading and storing sample data (`INSTRUCTOR_SAMPLE_DATA`) and email templates from resource files.
2. A `populateTemplate` method that replaces placeholders in a template string with provided key-value pairs.
3. A nested `EmailTemplates` class containing constants for various email templates used by the system (course join notifications, feedback session emails, etc.), all loaded from HTML resource files.

The class serves as a central repository for template strings and provides a simple templating mechanism for string substitution.
