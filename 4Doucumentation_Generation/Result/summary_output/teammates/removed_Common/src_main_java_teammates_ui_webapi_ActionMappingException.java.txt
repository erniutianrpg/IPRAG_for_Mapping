The `ActionMappingException` class is a custom exception that indicates a controller class failed to instantiate from a given URL. It carries an HTTP status code (typically 404 or 405) and a message, extending Java's base `Exception` class. The status code can be retrieved via `getStatusCode()`. This exception helps handle URL routing failures in web APIs. (58 words)
