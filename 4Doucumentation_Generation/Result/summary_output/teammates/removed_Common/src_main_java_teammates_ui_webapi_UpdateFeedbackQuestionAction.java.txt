This code defines an API action (`UpdateFeedbackQuestionAction`) that updates a feedback question in a system. It checks if the user is authorized, validates the update request, modifies the question attributes (number, description, visibility settings, etc.), performs validation checks, and saves the updated question. If successful, it returns the updated question data; otherwise, it throws appropriate exceptions for invalid requests or non-existent entities.
