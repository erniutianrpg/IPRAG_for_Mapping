This code implements a custom time-zone rules provider (`TzdbResourceZoneRulesProvider`) that loads time-zone data from a resource file (`tzdb.dat`) instead of the default JRE location. It extends `ZoneRulesProvider` to read and parse binary time-zone rules, including transitions and offsets, and provides them via standard Java Time API interfaces. Key functionalities include loading rules from a file, caching them, and supporting operations like fetching rules by zone ID or version. The code is adapted from Java's internal `TzdbZoneRulesProvider` but modified to work with resource files.
