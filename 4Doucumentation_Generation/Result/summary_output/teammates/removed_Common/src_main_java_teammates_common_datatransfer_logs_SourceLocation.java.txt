The `SourceLocation` class represents the location of source code that generates a log line. It stores three attributes: file path, line number, and function name. The class provides getter methods for these attributes and overrides `equals()` and `hashCode()` to compare `SourceLocation` objects based on their file, line, and function values. This ensures proper equality checks and hash-based operations.
