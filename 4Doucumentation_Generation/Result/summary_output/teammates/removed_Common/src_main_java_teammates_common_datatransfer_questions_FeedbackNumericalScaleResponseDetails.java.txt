This code defines a class `FeedbackNumericalScaleResponseDetails` that handles numerical scale responses in feedback systems. It extends `FeedbackResponseDetails` and stores a numerical `answer` (defaulting to `POINTS_NOT_SUBMITTED` if unset). It provides methods to get/set the answer and format it as a decimal string. The class is specialized for numerical scale feedback questions. (Words: 50)
