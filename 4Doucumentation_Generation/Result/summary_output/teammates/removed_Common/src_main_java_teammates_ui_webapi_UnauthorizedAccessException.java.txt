The `UnauthorizedAccessException` is a custom exception for HTTP 403 errors, thrown when an entity lacks permission to access resources. It includes a flag (`showErrorMessage`) to control whether the error message is displayed to the user (generic message shown if `false`) or revealed (if `true`), though admins always see the full message in logs. This balances security by hiding sensitive details while allowing helpful messages in non-sensitive cases.
