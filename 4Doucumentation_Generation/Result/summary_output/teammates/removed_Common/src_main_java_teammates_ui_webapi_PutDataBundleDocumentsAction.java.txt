This code defines an API action (`PutDataBundleDocumentsAction`) that uploads searchable documents from a provided data bundle into a database. It requires admin privileges and only works in development environments. If successful, it returns a success message; if it fails (throwing `SearchServiceException`), it returns a 502 error with a failure message. The data bundle is parsed from the request body as JSON.
