This code is the entry point for a Java web application using Jetty server. It:

1. Configures a Jetty server on a specified port
2. Sets up a web application context with the WAR file path
3. Optionally adds a dev server login servlet if running in development mode
4. Implements lifecycle listeners for logging startup/shutdown events and failures
5. Starts the server and keeps it running until shutdown

The application serves as the main deployment point, handling server initialization and lifecycle management with logging.
