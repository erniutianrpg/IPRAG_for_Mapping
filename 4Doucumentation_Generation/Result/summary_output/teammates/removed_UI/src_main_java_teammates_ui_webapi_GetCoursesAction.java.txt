This code handles a web API endpoint that retrieves course lists for users. For students, it returns courses they're enrolled in, hiding sensitive data. For instructors, it fetches courses filtered by status (active/archived/soft-deleted) and includes their permissions. The endpoint requires authentication and validates that users can only access appropriate data (students get student data, instructors get instructor data). The response is formatted as JSON containing course information with relevant permissions for instructors.
