This code defines a `FeedbackQuestionRecipientsData` class that represents API output for feedback question recipients. It converts a map of `FeedbackQuestionRecipient` objects into a sorted list of `FeedbackQuestionRecipientData` objects, ordering them by recipient name. The class provides a getter method to retrieve the sorted list of recipients. Essentially, it serves as a data transfer object for feedback recipient information in an API response.
