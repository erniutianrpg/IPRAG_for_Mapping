This Java code defines a `DeleteDataBundleAction` class that handles deleting a data bundle from the database. It requires admin privileges and only works in development servers. The action accepts a JSON request body containing the data bundle, removes it using the `logic.removeDataBundle` method, and returns a success message. Auth is restricted to all-access users, with additional checks for dev server environment.
