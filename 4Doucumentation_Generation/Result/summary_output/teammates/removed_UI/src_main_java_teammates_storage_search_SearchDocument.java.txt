This abstract class `SearchDocument` provides a base structure for converting entities (`T` extending `EntityAttributes`) into searchable documents. It holds the entity's attributes and requires implementing classes to define `getSearchableFields()`, which returns a map of fields for indexing/searching. Essentially, it standardizes how entities are prepared for search operations. (50 words)
