This code updates a notification banner in a system. It takes a notification ID and update request (including start/end times, style, target user, title, and message) as input. The action validates the request, builds an update object, and attempts to update the notification via the logic layer. If successful, it returns the updated notification data; otherwise, it throws exceptions for invalid parameters or non-existent entities. This is an admin-only action. (98 words)
