This code defines a `FeedbackQuestion` entity class for a feedback system, representing questions in feedback sessions. It stores attributes like question text, description, type, participant types (giver/recipient), visibility settings, and timestamps. The class includes methods to get/set these attributes and handles ID generation for database storage. The `@OnSave` annotation ensures the `updatedAt` timestamp is refreshed whenever the entity is saved.
