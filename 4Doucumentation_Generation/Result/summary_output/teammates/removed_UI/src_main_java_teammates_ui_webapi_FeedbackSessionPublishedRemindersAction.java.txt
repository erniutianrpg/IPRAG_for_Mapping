This code is a cron job that schedules email notifications for published feedback sessions. It retrieves a list of feedback sessions requiring automated published emails, then queues each session's email notification for sending. The action is restricted to admin users and returns a "Successful" message upon completion. The `RequestTracer` ensures the operation stays within time limits.
