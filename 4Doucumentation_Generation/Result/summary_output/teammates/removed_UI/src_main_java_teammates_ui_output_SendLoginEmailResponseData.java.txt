The `SendLoginEmailResponseData` class is an output format for login email request responses. It contains two fields: `isEmailSent` (a boolean indicating if the email was sent) and `message` (a string providing additional details). The class provides getter methods to access these fields, allowing the response status and message to be retrieved after a login email request.
