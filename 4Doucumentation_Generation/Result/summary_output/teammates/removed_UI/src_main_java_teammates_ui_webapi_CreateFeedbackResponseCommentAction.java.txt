This code creates a new feedback response comment in an educational feedback system. It handles three scenarios: student submissions, instructor submissions, and instructor results. For each, it validates access rights, checks if the session is open, verifies question/response ownership, and ensures the comment text isn't empty. Based on the user's role (student/instructor) and intent, it creates and stores the comment with appropriate visibility settings, returning the created comment data. The code includes thorough validation to prevent unauthorized access or invalid operations.
