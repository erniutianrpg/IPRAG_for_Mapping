The `LogicStarter` class initializes and sets up dependencies between various logic classes (like `AccountsLogic`, `CoursesLogic`, etc.) when the web application starts. It implements `ServletContextListener` to trigger `initializeDependencies()` during startup, which creates instances of each logic class and calls their `initLogicDependencies()` methods. This ensures all required dependencies are ready before the application runs. The class logs the initialization completion. No cleanup is needed on shutdown.
