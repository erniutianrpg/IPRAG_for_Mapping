This servlet filter handles HTTP requests by: 1) Setting security headers (HSTS, cache control), 2) Generating/extracting trace IDs for request tracking, 3) Setting timeout limits (60s for user requests, 595s for App Engine tasks), 4) Checking for maintenance mode, and 5) Validating request parameters. It ensures proper request tracing, security, and error handling before passing requests to the next filter in the chain.
