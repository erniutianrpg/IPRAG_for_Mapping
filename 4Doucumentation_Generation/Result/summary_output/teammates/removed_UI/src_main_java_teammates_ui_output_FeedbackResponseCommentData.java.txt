The `FeedbackResponseCommentData` class is an API output format for feedback response comments. It converts `FeedbackResponseCommentAttributes` into a structured output with fields like comment ID, text, giver, timestamps, visibility settings, and editor info. It also includes a method to convert feedback participant types into comment visibility types (e.g., instructors, students). The class provides getter methods for all fields, making the data accessible for API responses.
