This code is a cron job that compiles application logs with severity `ERROR` or higher from the past 6 minutes and sends them via email to a support address. It checks for logs within a slightly overlapping time range (6 minutes) to ensure no logs are missed between 5-minute intervals. If no severe logs are found, no email is sent to avoid spamming. The action is restricted to admin users only.
