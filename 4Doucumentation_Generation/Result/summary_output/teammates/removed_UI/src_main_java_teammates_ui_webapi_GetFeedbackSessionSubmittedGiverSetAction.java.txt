This code defines an API action `GetFeedbackSessionSubmittedGiverSetAction` that retrieves a set of givers who have submitted at least one response in a specified feedback session. It requires logged-in access and verifies the user is an authorized instructor for the session. The action takes course ID and feedback session name as input, queries the giver set from the logic layer, and returns it as JSON output.
