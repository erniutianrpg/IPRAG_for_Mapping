This code is a worker action that handles sending published feedback session reminder emails. It retrieves a feedback session by name and course ID, generates emails for participants using `emailGenerator`, queues them for sending via `taskQueuer`, and updates the session's `sentPublishedEmail` status. If the session doesn't exist or an error occurs, it logs the issue and returns a failure status. On success, it returns "Successful". The action is restricted to admin users.
