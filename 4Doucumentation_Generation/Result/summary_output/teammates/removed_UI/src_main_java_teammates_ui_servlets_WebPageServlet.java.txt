The `WebPageServlet` is a Java servlet that handles GET requests by forwarding them to `index.html`. If a `BadMessageException` occurs, it logs the error, returns a 400 Bad Request status, and writes the error message to the response. Other runtime exceptions are rethrown. Essentially, it serves the main web page while handling specific errors gracefully. (72 words)
