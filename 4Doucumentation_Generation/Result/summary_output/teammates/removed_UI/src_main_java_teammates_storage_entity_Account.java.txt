The `Account` class represents a user entity in the system, storing their Google ID, name, email, read notifications (mapped by ID to timestamp), and account creation time. It provides getters and setters for these fields, initializes with current time on creation, and ensures `readNotifications` returns an empty map if null. The class is annotated for Objectify (Google Datastore) with indexing, translation, and serialization directives.
