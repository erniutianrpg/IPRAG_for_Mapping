The `InstructorData` class is an API output format representing instructor information. It encapsulates attributes like Google ID, course ID, email, display settings, name, role, join status, and optional fields like registration key and institute. The class provides getters and setters for these fields and includes a constructor that initializes basic attributes from `InstructorAttributes`. A special method `addAdditionalInformationForAdminSearch` adds admin-specific details (key, institute, Google ID) for search results. The class serves as a data transfer object for instructor-related API responses.
