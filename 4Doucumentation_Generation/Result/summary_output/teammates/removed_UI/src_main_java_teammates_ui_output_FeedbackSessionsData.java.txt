This code defines a `FeedbackSessionsData` class that serves as an API output format for a list of feedback sessions. It converts a list of `FeedbackSessionAttributes` into a list of `FeedbackSessionData` objects using Java streams. The class provides a getter method to retrieve the transformed list. Essentially, it acts as a wrapper to present feedback session data in a structured format for API responses. (94 words)
