This code defines a `CourseCreateRequest` class that extends `CourseBasicRequest` for creating a course. It includes a `courseId` field with getter and setter methods. The `validate()` method checks that `courseId` is not null (using parent class validation first) and throws an exception if validation fails. Essentially, it handles course creation requests with basic validation. (59 words)
