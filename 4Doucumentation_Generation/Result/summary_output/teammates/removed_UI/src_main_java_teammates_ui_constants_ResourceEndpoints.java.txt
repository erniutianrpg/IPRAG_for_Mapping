This code defines an enum `ResourceEndpoints` that maps various API endpoint constants to their corresponding URI strings from `ResourceURIs`. Each enum value represents a specific API endpoint (e.g., `ERROR_REPORT`, `AUTH`, `COURSE`) and stores its associated URL. The `@JsonValue` annotation ensures that when serialized to JSON, the endpoint's URL string is used. Essentially, it provides a centralized collection of API endpoint URIs for the application.
