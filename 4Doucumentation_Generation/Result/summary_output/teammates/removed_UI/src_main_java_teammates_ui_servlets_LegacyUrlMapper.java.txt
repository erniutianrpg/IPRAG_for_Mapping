This servlet maps legacy URLs to new ones for backward compatibility, primarily for email links. It handles various cases like course join pages, home pages, and feedback submission/results pages for both students and instructors. For each legacy URL, it constructs a new URL with appropriate parameters and redirects users permanently (HTTP 301). Unmapped URLs trigger a warning log and redirect to the home page. The class is marked as deprecated, indicating these legacy URLs should eventually be phased out.
