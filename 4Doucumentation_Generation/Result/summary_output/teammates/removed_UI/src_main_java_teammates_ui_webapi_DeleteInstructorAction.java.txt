This code defines a `DeleteInstructorAction` class that handles deleting an instructor from a course. It checks if the requester is authorized (admin or instructor with modify permissions) and ensures the instructor isn't the last one in the course. If valid, it deletes the instructor and returns a success message. The action prevents deletion if it would leave the course without instructors or visible instructors.
