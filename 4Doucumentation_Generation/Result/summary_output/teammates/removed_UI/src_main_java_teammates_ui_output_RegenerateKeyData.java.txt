The `RegenerateKeyData` class is an API output format that encapsulates the response for a key regeneration request. It contains two fields: a `message` (status/feedback message) and a `newRegistrationKey` (the regenerated key). The class provides getter methods to access these fields. This serves as a simple data transfer object for communicating the result of a key regeneration operation.
