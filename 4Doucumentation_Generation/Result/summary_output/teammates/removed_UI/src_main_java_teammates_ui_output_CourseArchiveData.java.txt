The `CourseArchiveData` class is an API output format that represents the archived status of a course. It contains two fields: `courseId` (a string identifying the course) and `isArchived` (a boolean indicating whether the course is archived). The class provides getter methods to access these fields. This serves as a simple data structure to communicate course archival information in API responses. (72 words)
