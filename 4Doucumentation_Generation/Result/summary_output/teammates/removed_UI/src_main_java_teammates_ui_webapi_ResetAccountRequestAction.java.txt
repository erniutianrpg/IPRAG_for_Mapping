This code defines a `ResetAccountRequestAction` class that resets an account request for an instructor. It checks if the account request exists and is registered, then updates it by clearing the registration timestamp. It generates and sends a new join link email to the instructor, returning the link as JSON output. The action is restricted to admin users only.
