This code creates a new instructor account with sample demo courses. It validates a registration key, checks for existing accounts, imports demo course data with adjusted timestamps for the instructor's timezone, generates a unique course ID, and updates the account request status. The demo course includes sample sessions, students, and instructors, with proper timezone adjustments. The course ID is generated from the instructor's email, ensuring uniqueness by appending numbers if needed.
