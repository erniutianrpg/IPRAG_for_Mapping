This code is a worker action that indexes an instructor's data for search functionality. It takes a course ID and instructor email as input, retrieves the instructor's details, and attempts to index them. If indexing fails (throwing SearchServiceException), it returns a 502 error to trigger an automatic retry. On success, it returns a "Successful" message. The action is restricted to admin users only.
