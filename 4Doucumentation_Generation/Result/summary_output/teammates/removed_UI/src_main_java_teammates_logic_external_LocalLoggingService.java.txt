The `LocalLoggingService` class simulates a logging service for local development/testing. It provides:
1. In-memory storage for feedback session logs
2. Loading of mock logs from a JSON file with randomized timestamps
3. Querying logs with various filters (severity, timestamp, trace ID, etc.)
4. Creating and retrieving feedback session logs by course, email, or session name
5. Pagination support for log queries

This implementation mimics cloud logging services locally for testing purposes without persistent storage.
