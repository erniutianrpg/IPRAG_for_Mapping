The `CoursesData` class is an API output wrapper that converts a list of `CourseAttributes` into a list of `CourseData` objects. It takes a list of `CourseAttributes` in its constructor, transforms each into `CourseData`, and provides a getter method (`getCourses()`) to retrieve the converted list. This serves as a data transfer object for course information in API responses. (78 words)
