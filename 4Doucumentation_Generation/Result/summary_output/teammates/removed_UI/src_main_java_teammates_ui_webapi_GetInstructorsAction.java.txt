This code defines a `GetInstructorsAction` API endpoint that retrieves instructor details for a course. It checks access control: admins get full access, students see limited info, and instructors see full details if authorized. The response varies based on the request's `intent` parameter - either returning basic instructor info (hidden details for students) or full details (including Google IDs for privileged users). The endpoint ensures proper authorization before returning filtered or complete instructor data.
