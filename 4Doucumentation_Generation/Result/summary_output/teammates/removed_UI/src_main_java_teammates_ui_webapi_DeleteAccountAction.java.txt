This code defines a `DeleteAccountAction` class that handles the deletion of a user account (student or instructor). It's an admin-only action that takes a Google ID as a parameter, cascades the deletion (including associated data) via the `logic.deleteAccountCascade` method, and returns a success message upon completion. The action ensures the Google ID parameter is not null before processing.
