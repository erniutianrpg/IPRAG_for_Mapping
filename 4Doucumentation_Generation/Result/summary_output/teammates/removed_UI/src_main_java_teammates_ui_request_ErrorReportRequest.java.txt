The `ErrorReportRequest` class defines a request structure for sending error reports to an admin. It contains three fields: `content`, `subject`, and `requestId`, which are validated to ensure they are not null. The class provides getter methods to access these fields and extends `BasicRequest`, inheriting basic request functionalities. This request is used to encapsulate error report data before sending it via email.
