The `QuestionTypeStructures` enum provides default JSON structures for various feedback question and response types in a teaching/learning system. It includes default configurations for different question formats (MCQ, MSQ, numerical scale, rubric, etc.) and their corresponding response formats. Each enum value represents a specific question/response type and stores its default structure as a compact JSON string. The class also includes helper methods to create specific constant-sum question structures (options and recipients variants). This serves as a central repository of default question/response templates for the application.
