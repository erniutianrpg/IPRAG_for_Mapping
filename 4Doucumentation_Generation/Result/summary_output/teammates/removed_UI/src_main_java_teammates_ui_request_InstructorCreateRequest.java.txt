The `InstructorCreateRequest` class defines a request object for creating an instructor, containing fields like ID, name, email, role, display name, and visibility to students. It validates that essential fields (name, email, role, and visibility flag) are not null. The class provides getter methods to access these fields, converting the role to an enum via `InstructorPermissionRole`. This serves as a data container and validator for instructor creation requests. (98 words)
