This code creates a new instructor account request. It validates the request, checks for duplicates, and either creates a new account request or uses an existing one if already present. If the instructor is already registered, it throws an error. Otherwise, it generates and sends a join link email to the instructor and returns the join link as output. The action is restricted to admin users only.
