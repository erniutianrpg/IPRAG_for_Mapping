The `WebApiServlet` is a central servlet that handles all HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for a web application. It delegates requests to appropriate `Action` classes via `ActionFactory`, executes them, and handles responses or errors. It manages various exceptions (e.g., unauthorized access, invalid parameters, entity not found) by returning appropriate HTTP status codes and logging errors. For App Engine queue requests, it adjusts error handling to prevent retries. Finally, it logs request details including status code, action class, user info, and request body.
