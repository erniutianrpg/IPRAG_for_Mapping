The `LogoutServlet` handles user logout by: (1) invalidating the current session, (2) adding a cookie to invalidate login, and (3) redirecting to the home page (`/web`). If a `frontendUrl` parameter is provided, it prepends this to the redirect path. The response status is 302 (MOVED_TEMPORARILY) for the redirect. This servlet extends `AuthServlet` for authentication-related functionality.
