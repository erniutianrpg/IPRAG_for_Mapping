This code defines a `BinCourseAction` class that moves a course to the recycle bin. It checks if the user is an authorized instructor, verifies access control, and then moves the specified course to the recycle bin by updating its deletion timestamp. The course ID is obtained from the request parameters. If successful, it returns the updated course data; if the course doesn't exist, it throws an `EntityNotFoundException`. The action requires logged-in users with instructor privileges.
