This code handles sending join reminder emails for course registration. It checks if the requester is authorized (either an instructor modifying students/other instructors or a logged-in user). Based on request parameters, it sends reminders to: a specific student, a specific instructor, or all unregistered students in a course. The emails are queued for sending, and appropriate success messages are returned. Access control ensures only authorized users can send reminders.
