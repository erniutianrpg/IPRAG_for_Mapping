The `FeedbackResponseCommentCreateRequest` class is a request object for creating a feedback response comment. It extends `FeedbackResponseCommentBasicRequest` and takes three parameters: `commentText` (the comment content), `showCommentTo` (visibility settings for the comment), and `showGiverNameTo` (visibility settings for the comment giver's name). It inherits basic comment functionality from its parent class.
