This code defines a `GetStudentAction` class that retrieves and returns a student's information from a course. It handles three access scenarios: 1) instructors accessing a student's data (with proper permissions), 2) unregistered students accessing their own data via a registration key, and 3) registered students accessing their own data. The method performs authorization checks, retrieves the student data, and returns it in a `StudentData` object, hiding sensitive information when accessed by non-instructors. Admins get additional details like the student's key and Google ID.
