This code defines a `CreateCourseAction` class that handles creating a new course for an instructor. It checks if the user is authorized (must be an instructor with co-owner privileges at the specified institute), validates the course details (timezone, ID, name), and creates the course. If successful, it schedules the instructor for search indexing and returns the course data. Errors are thrown for invalid parameters, duplicate course IDs, or unauthorized access.
