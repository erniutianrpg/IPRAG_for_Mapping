The `FeedbackResponseCommentUpdateRequest` class is a request object for updating a feedback response comment. It extends `FeedbackResponseCommentBasicRequest` and inherits its fields: `commentText` (the comment content), `showCommentTo` (visibility settings for the comment), and `showGiverNameTo` (visibility settings for the comment giver's name). The class provides a constructor to initialize these fields. Essentially, it encapsulates the data needed to update an existing feedback response comment's text and visibility settings.
