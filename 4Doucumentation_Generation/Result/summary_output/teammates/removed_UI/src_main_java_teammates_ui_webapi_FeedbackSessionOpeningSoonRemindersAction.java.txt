This code is a cron job that schedules "opening soon" reminder emails for upcoming feedback sessions. It retrieves sessions opening soon, generates emails for each session, queues them for sending, and marks the sessions as having sent reminders. If errors occur during email scheduling, they are logged. The action is restricted to admin users and returns a success message upon completion.
