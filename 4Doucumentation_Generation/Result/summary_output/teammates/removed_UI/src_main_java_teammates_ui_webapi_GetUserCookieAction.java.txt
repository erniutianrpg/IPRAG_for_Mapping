The `GetUserCookieAction` class is a backend API action that generates and returns an encrypted user cookie. It requires a backdoor key for access. When executed with a provided user ID, it creates a `UserInfoCookie`, converts it to a compact JSON string, encrypts it, and returns the result. The action is restricted to authorized access only.
