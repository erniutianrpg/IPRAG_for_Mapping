The `GeneralLogsData` class is an API output format that encapsulates general log entries and pagination information. It takes a `QueryLogsResults` object, stores its log entries in a list, and indicates whether more pages exist (`hasNextPage`). The class provides getter methods to access these fields. Essentially, it serves as a container for log query results to be returned by an API. (Word count: 58)
