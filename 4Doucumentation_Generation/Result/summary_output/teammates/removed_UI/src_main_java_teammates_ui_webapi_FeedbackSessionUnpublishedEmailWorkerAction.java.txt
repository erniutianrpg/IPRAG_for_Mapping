This code is a worker action that handles sending unpublished notifications for a feedback session. It retrieves a specific feedback session using its name and course ID, generates unpublished notification emails for participants, queues them for sending, and updates the session's status to mark that published emails are no longer valid. If any errors occur during this process, it logs them and returns an appropriate success/failure response.
