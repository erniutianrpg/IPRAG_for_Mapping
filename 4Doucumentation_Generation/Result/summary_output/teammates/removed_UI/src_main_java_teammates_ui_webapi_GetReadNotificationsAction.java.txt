This code defines a `GetReadNotificationsAction` class that handles an API request to fetch read notifications for a logged-in user. It checks that the user is authenticated, allows any logged-in user to access their own read notifications, retrieves the notification IDs from the database using the user's ID, and returns them as JSON output. The class extends a base `Action` class, following a typical web API action pattern.
