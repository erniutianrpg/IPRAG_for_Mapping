This module serves as the core backend system for an educational platform, providing comprehensive functionality for course management, feedback sessions, user authentication, and administrative operations. It handles all web API requests through a structured servlet architecture, supporting features like student/instructor enrollment, feedback collection and analysis, session scheduling with automated reminders, and robust access control based on user roles. The system includes extensive logging, error handling, and security measures while offering both production and development environment support. Key components include user management (accounts, privileges), feedback workflows (questions, responses, comments), course operations (creation, archiving, deletion), and various automated email notifications. The architecture follows a clear separation between request handling, business logic, and data persistence layers, with well-defined API endpoints and output formats for frontend integration.
