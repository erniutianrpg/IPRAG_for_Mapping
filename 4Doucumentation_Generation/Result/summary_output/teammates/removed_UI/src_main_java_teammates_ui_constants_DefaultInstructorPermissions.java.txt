This code defines an enum `DefaultInstructorPermissions` that represents different instructor roles (COOWNER, MANAGER, OBSERVER, TUTOR, CUSTOM) with associated privileges. Each role's permissions are fetched using `getPrivileges()`, which retrieves course-level privileges from `InstructorPrivileges`. The enum values are serialized to compact JSON strings with escaped quotes. The class serves as a centralized structure for default instructor permission sets in a system.
