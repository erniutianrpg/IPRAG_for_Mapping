The `AccountRequestData` class is a data transfer object (DTO) that represents account request information in a structured output format. It encapsulates details like email, name, institute, registration key, and timestamps (created and registered) from `AccountRequestAttributes`. The class provides getter methods to access these fields, with `registeredAt` being nullable if the account hasn't been registered yet. This output format is likely used for API responses. (98 words)
