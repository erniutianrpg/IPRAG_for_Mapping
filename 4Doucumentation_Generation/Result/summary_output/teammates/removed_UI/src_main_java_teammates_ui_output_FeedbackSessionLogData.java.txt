The `FeedbackSessionLogData` class encapsulates a feedback session's data and its associated log entries. It takes a `FeedbackSessionAttributes` object, a list of log entries (`FeedbackSessionLogEntry`), and a map of students, then converts them into output-friendly formats (`FeedbackSessionData` and `FeedbackSessionLogEntryData`). The class provides getter methods to access the session data and log entries, serving as a structured response object for feedback session logs. (94 words)
