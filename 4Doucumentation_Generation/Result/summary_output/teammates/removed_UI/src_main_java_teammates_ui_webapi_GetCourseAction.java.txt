This code defines a `GetCourseAction` class that handles API requests to fetch course details. It checks if the requester (admin, instructor, or student) has proper access rights. For instructors, it includes their privileges; for students, it hides sensitive information. The endpoint returns course data in JSON format, throwing exceptions for unauthorized access or missing courses. The action is publicly accessible but enforces role-based data filtering.
