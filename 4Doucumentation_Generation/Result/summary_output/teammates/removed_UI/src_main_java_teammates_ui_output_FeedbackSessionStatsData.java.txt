The `FeedbackSessionStatsData` class is a simple API output model that tracks feedback session statistics. It stores two integers: `submittedTotal` (number of submitted responses) and `expectedTotal` (total expected responses). The class provides getter methods to access these values but no setters, making it immutable once constructed. It extends `ApiOutput`, indicating it's used for API responses. (72 words)
