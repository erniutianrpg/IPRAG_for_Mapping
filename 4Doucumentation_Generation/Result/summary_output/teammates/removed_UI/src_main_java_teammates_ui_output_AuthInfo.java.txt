The `AuthInfo` class represents authentication information in an API response. It provides login URLs for different user roles (student, instructor, admin, maintainer) when the user is not logged in, or user details and masquerade status when authenticated. The class has two constructors: one for unauthenticated users (with login URLs) and one for authenticated users (with UserInfo and masquerade flag). It includes getter methods for all fields. The class serves as a data transfer object for authentication-related responses.
