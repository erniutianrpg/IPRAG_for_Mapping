This code handles retrieving feedback response comments in a web API. It checks access control based on user role (student/instructor) and intent, verifies if the feedback response exists, and returns either the comment data or an appropriate error message if the comment/response doesn't exist or access is denied. The endpoint is publicly accessible but enforces specific permission checks.
