This code handles the submission of feedback responses for a specific question in a feedback session. It validates the user's access rights (student/instructor), checks if the session is open, and processes the submitted responses. It either creates new responses, updates existing ones, or deletes removed responses. The action ensures data integrity by validating responses against question requirements before persisting them. The result is a list of saved feedback responses.
