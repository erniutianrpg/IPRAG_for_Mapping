The `JsonResult` class is a REST API action result that sends JSON responses. It constructs JSON outputs from either an `ApiOutput` object or a message string, with optional HTTP status codes and cookies. When sent via `HttpServletResponse`, it sets cookies (with security in dev), status code, content type, and writes the compact JSON output. It's commonly used for REST API responses in the application. (98 words)
