The `EnrollStudentsData` class is an API output wrapper that provides enrollment results, containing two main components: `studentsData` for successful enrollments and `unsuccessfulEnrolls` (a list of `EnrollErrorResults`) for failed enrollments. Each `EnrollErrorResults` entry includes the student's email and an error message. The class offers getters and setters for both components. In essence, it structures and returns enrollment outcomes, distinguishing between successful and failed attempts.
