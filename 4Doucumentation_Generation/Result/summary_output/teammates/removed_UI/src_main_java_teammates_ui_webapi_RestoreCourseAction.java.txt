This code defines a `RestoreCourseAction` class that handles restoring a course from the Recycle Bin in a web API. It checks if the user is an authorized instructor, verifies access permissions, then restores the specified course. If successful, it returns a confirmation message; if the course doesn't exist, it throws an exception. The action requires logged-in users with instructor privileges.
