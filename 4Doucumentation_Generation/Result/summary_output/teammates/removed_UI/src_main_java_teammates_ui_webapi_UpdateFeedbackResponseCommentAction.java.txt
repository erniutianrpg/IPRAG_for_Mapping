This Java code updates a feedback response comment in a system (likely an educational platform). It handles three scenarios: student submissions, instructor submissions, and instructor results. For each, it verifies permissions, checks if the session is open, validates the comment content, and updates the comment with new text, visibility settings, and editor info. The updated comment is then returned as JSON. Access control ensures only authorized users (comment givers, instructors with proper privileges) can modify comments.
