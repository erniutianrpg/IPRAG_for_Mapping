The `HasResponsesData` class is an API output format that indicates whether responses exist, either for a single entry or multiple sessions. It provides two constructors: one for a simple boolean check (`hasResponses`) and another for a session-based map (`hasResponsesBySession`). The class includes getter methods to retrieve the response status, either as a single boolean or a map of session names to their respective response statuses. This output structure helps clients determine if there are responses without exposing the actual data.
