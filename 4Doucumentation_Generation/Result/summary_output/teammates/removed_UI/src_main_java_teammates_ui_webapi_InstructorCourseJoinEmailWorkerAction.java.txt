This code is a worker action that sends a course registration email to an instructor. It checks if the course and instructor exist, determines whether it's a rejoin request or new invitation, generates the appropriate email (rejoin or new join), and sends it. For new joins, it also validates the inviter's account. The action ensures instructors receive proper notification when joining or rejoining a course.
