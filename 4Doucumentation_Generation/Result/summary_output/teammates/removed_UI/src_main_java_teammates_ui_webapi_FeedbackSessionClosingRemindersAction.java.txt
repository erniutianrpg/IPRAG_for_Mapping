This code implements a cron job that sends reminder emails for closing feedback sessions. It:

1. Fetches sessions closing soon and sends closing emails to participants
2. Updates session status to mark emails as sent
3. Handles sessions with deadline extensions by:
   - Grouping extensions by course/session
   - Filtering valid extensions
   - Sending extended deadline emails
   - Updating extension status
4. Validates extensions against session deadlines before sending

The job ensures participants receive timely reminders while handling both regular and extended deadlines.
