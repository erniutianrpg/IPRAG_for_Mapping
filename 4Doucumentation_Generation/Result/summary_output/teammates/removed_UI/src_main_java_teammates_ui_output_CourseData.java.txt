The `CourseData` class is an API output format representing course information. It includes details like course ID, name, timezone, institute, creation/deletion timestamps, and instructor privileges. The constructor initializes these fields from a `CourseAttributes` object. There are getters and setters for all fields, plus a `hideInformationForStudent()` method that obscures timestamps from student views. This class serves as a data transfer object for course-related API responses.
