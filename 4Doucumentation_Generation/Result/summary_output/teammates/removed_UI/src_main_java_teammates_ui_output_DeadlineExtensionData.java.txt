The `DeadlineExtensionData` class is an output format for deadline extension information. It wraps `DeadlineExtensionAttributes` into a structured API response, including course ID, feedback session name, user email, user role (instructor/student), whether a closing email was sent, and the extended deadline timestamp. The class provides getter methods for all these fields.
