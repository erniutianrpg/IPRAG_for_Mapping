The `StudentUpdateRequest` class represents a request to update student details. It sanitizes input fields (name, email, team, section, comments) and validates that none are null. It provides getter methods for each field, with the section defaulting to `Const.DEFAULT_SECTION` if empty. The class also includes a flag (`isSessionSummarySendEmail`) to indicate if session summary emails should be sent.
