This code defines a `GetFeedbackSessionAction` class that handles API requests to retrieve feedback session details in a course management system. It checks access control based on the requester's role (student or instructor) and intent (submission, result, or full detail view), then returns appropriate feedback session data with role-specific information hidden as needed. The functionality includes validation of user permissions and tailoring response data based on whether the requester is a student or instructor.
