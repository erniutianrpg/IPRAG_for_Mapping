This code defines an enum `FeedbackVisibilityType` that represents different visibility settings for feedback in an educational context. It specifies who can view the feedback: the recipient (`RECIPIENT`), the giver's team members (`GIVER_TEAM_MEMBERS`), the recipient's team members (`RECIPIENT_TEAM_MEMBERS`), all students in the course (`STUDENTS`), or all instructors (`INSTRUCTORS`). The enum serves as a set of predefined constants for feedback visibility options. (98 words)
