This servlet handles login functionality for a development server. The `doGet` method checks if login is enabled and redirects accordingly, serving a login page if needed. The `doPost` method processes login requests, validates the email, sets a user cookie, and redirects to the specified URL. It includes security measures like preventing HTTP response splitting and cookie validation. If dev server login is disabled, it redirects to the main login page or returns a forbidden status.
