This code is a worker action that indexes an account request for search functionality. It takes an instructor's email and institution as input, retrieves the corresponding account request, and attempts to index it. If indexing fails (throws SearchServiceException), it returns a 502 error to trigger an automatic retry. On success, it returns a "Successful" message. The action is restricted to admin users only.
