This code adds a new instructor to an existing course. It verifies the requester's admin/instructor privileges, validates the request parameters, sanitizes inputs, creates an instructor with basic attributes (name, email, role, visibility), and adds them to the course. It also schedules invitation emails and search indexing. The action returns the new instructor's data or errors if the instructor already exists or parameters are invalid.
