This code defines an API action (`GetFeedbackQuestionRecipientsAction`) that retrieves the recipients for a specific feedback question in a course. It checks access control based on whether the requester is a student or instructor, verifies the question exists and is answerable, then returns the recipients as a `FeedbackQuestionRecipientsData` object. The action supports both student and instructor intents for feedback submissions.
