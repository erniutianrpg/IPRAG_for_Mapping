This code defines a `CreateFeedbackQuestionAction` class that handles the creation of feedback questions in a web API. It verifies the instructor's authentication and access rights, then processes the request to create a feedback question. The code validates the question's giver-recipient visibility and details, creates the question in the system, and returns the created question's data. If validation fails, it throws appropriate exceptions. The action is restricted to logged-in instructors with session modification permissions.
