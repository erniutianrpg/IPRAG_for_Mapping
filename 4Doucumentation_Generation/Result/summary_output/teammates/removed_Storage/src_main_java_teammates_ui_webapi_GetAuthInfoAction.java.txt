This code handles authentication information retrieval in a web API. It checks if a user is logged in: if not, it generates login URLs for different user roles (student, instructor, admin, maintainer) with optional redirect URLs. If logged in, it returns the user's info. It also manages CSRF token validation, creating and setting a new token cookie if none exists or if it's invalid. The endpoint is publicly accessible.
