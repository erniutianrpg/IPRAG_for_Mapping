This code defines a `CreateCourseAction` class that handles creating a new course for an instructor in a web API. It checks if the user is an authorized instructor from the specified institution, validates the course details (timezone, ID, name), creates the course, and associates the instructor with it. If the course ID already exists or parameters are invalid, it throws appropriate exceptions. On success, it returns the new course's data.
