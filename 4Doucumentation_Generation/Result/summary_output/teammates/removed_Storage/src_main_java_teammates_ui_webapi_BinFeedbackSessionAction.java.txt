This code defines a `BinFeedbackSessionAction` class that moves a feedback session to the recycle bin. It requires the user to be logged in and have instructor-level permissions to modify the session. The action takes a course ID and feedback session name as input, moves the session to the recycle bin via `logic.moveFeedbackSessionToRecycleBin()`, and returns the recycled session data as JSON. If the session doesn't exist, it throws an `EntityNotFoundException`.
