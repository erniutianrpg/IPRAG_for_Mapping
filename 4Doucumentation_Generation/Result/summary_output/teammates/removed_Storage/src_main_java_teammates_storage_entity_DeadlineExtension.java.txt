The `DeadlineExtension` class is an entity representing a student's extended deadline for a feedback session in a course. It stores details like course ID, session name, user email, instructor status, closing email status, deadline end time, and timestamps for creation/updates. The class includes methods to generate a unique ID from these attributes and automatically updates the `updatedAt` timestamp when saved. It's designed for persistence using Objectify with appropriate annotations.
