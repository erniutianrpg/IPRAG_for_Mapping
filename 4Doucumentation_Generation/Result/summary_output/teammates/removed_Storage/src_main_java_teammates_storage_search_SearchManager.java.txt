This code is an abstract `SearchManager` class that acts as a proxy to a Solr search service. It provides core functionality for:
1. Creating/updating documents in Solr (`putDocument`)
2. Deleting documents (`deleteDocuments`)
3. Performing searches (`performQuery`) 
4. Resetting collections (`resetCollections`)
5. Converting between Solr documents and entity attributes

The class handles Solr connection management, query building with special character sanitization, error handling, and basic search operations. It's designed to be extended for specific entity types with abstract methods for collection-specific implementations.
