The `UsageStatistics` class is an entity that tracks system usage metrics over a specific time period. It stores counts for various user-facing activities like responses, courses, students, instructors, account requests, emails, and submissions. The entity includes a unique ID generated from the start time and period, along with getter methods for all fields. It's designed for persistence using Objectify with annotations like `@Entity` and `@Id`.
