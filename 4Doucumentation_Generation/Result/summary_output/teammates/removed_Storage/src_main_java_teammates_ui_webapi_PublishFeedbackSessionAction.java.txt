This code defines an API action to publish a feedback session in an educational system. It verifies the instructor's authentication and authorization to modify the session. If the session isn't already published, it publishes it and schedules notification emails if enabled. The action returns the published session data or appropriate error messages if the session doesn't exist or parameters are invalid.
