The `AccountRequestsDb` class handles CRUD operations for account requests in a system, using Google's Objectify for datastore operations. Key functionalities include:
- Creating/updating account requests and their search documents
- Searching account requests system-wide
- Retrieving requests by email/institute or registration key
- Updating/deleting requests
- Counting requests within a time range
- Managing search indexes via `AccountRequestSearchManager`

It follows a singleton pattern and extends `EntitiesDb` for common database operations, converting between entity objects (`AccountRequest`) and attributes (`AccountRequestAttributes`).
