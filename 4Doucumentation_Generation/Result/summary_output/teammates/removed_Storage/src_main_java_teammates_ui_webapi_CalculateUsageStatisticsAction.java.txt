This code calculates and stores usage statistics for a specified time period (60 minutes). It gathers data on entities (responses, courses, students, instructors, account requests), emails sent, and submissions from logs. The statistics are collected between the current time and the previous hour, then stored in the database. If storage fails, it logs an error. The action is restricted to admin users.
