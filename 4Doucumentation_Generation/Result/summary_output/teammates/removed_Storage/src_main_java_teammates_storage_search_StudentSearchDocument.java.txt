The `StudentSearchDocument` class creates searchable documents for student records by extracting key fields from `StudentAttributes` and `CourseAttributes`. It generates a map containing the student's ID, concatenated searchable text (name, email, course, etc.), course ID, and email. This enables efficient text-based searching of student data in a search engine or database.
