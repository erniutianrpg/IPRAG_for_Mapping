This code handles an API endpoint that retrieves all feedback responses given by a user (student or instructor) for a specific feedback question. It performs access control checks to verify the user's permissions, then fetches the responses from the database. For MCQ and MSQ question types, it also includes any participant comments. The responses are packaged into a JSON output format and returned. The endpoint supports both student and instructor intents with appropriate authorization checks.
