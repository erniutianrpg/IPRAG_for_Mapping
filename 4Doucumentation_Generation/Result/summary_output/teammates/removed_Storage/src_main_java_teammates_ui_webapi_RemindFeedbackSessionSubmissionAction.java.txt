This code defines an action to remind students about pending feedback submissions. It verifies the instructor's authority to modify the session, checks if the feedback session is open, then queues reminder emails for specified students. Optionally, it can send copies to the instructor. The action returns a success message after scheduling reminders. Access is restricted to logged-in users with instructor privileges.
