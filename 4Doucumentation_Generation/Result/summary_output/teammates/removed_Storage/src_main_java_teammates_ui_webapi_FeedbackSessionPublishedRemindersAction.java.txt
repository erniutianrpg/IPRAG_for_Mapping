This code is a cron job that schedules automated emails to be sent when feedback sessions are published. It retrieves all feedback sessions needing published notifications, then queues each session's email for sending. The `AdminOnlyAction` ensures only admins can trigger it. It returns "Successful" upon completion. The `RequestTracer` checks remaining execution time during iteration.
