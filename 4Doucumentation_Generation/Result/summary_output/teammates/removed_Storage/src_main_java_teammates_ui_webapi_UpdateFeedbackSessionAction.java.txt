This code updates a feedback session in a course management system. It validates the instructor's access, checks for valid submission times, and updates session details (instructions, deadlines, visibility times). It also handles deadline extensions for students/instructors by creating, updating, or revoking them, and sends notification emails if requested. The updated session data is returned as a JSON response.
