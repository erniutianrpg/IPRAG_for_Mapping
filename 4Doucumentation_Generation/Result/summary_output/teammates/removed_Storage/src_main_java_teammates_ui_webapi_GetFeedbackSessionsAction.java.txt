This code handles an API endpoint to retrieve feedback sessions for either students or instructors. It checks user authentication and access control, then fetches sessions based on the requester's role (student/instructor) and optional course ID. For students, it filters visible sessions and hides sensitive information. For instructors, it includes session privileges. The response contains session data formatted accordingly. The code also supports fetching sessions from recycle bins for instructors.
