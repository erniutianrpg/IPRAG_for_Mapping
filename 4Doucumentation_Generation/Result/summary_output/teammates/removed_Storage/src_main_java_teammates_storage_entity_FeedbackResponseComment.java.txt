The `FeedbackResponseComment` class represents a comment made by a giver (student, instructor, or team) on a feedback response in a course. It stores metadata like course/session/question IDs, giver/receiver details, visibility settings, timestamps, and the comment text. The class provides getters/setters for these fields and handles sanitization of comment text. It's designed as a persistent entity for database storage using Objectify annotations.
