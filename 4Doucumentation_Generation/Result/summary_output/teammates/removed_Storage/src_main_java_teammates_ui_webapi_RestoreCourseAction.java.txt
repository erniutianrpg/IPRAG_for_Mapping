This code defines a `RestoreCourseAction` class that handles restoring a course from the Recycle Bin in an educational system. It requires the user to be a logged-in instructor with course modification privileges. The action verifies access control, then restores the specified course by its ID. If successful, it returns a confirmation message; if the course doesn't exist, it throws an `EntityNotFoundException`. The functionality is part of a web API for course management.
