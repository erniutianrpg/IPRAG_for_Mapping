This code checks if a provided registration key is valid for a logged-in user in an educational system. It verifies the key's validity for both students and instructors based on the specified intent (e.g., submission or result). If the key is unused, access is granted. If used, access is only allowed if the logged-in user matches the key's associated account. The response indicates the key's validity, usage status, and access permission. The action is publicly accessible.
