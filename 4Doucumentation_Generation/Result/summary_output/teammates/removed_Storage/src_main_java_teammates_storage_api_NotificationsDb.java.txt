The `NotificationsDb` class handles CRUD operations for notifications using Google's Objectify. It provides methods to:
- Get a notification by ID
- Get all notifications (sorted by start time)
- Get active notifications for specific target users
- Update notifications with validation
- Delete notifications
- Check if a notification exists

It extends `EntitiesDb` for common database operations and ensures data validity through sanitization and checks. The class follows a singleton pattern and works with `Notification` entities and `NotificationAttributes` data transfer objects.
