This code handles the submission of feedback responses for a specific question in a feedback session. It validates access rights (for students or instructors), checks session availability, processes new/updated responses, deletes removed responses, and ensures data integrity. The action completely overwrites previous responses for the question, handling creation, updates, and deletions as needed while validating all inputs against business rules.
