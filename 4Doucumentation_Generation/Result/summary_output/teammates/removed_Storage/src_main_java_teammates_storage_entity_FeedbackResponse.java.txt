This code defines a `FeedbackResponse` entity class representing a feedback response in a system. It stores details like session name, course ID, question ID, giver/receiver information, response answer, and timestamps. The entity generates a unique ID combining question ID, giver, and receiver. It includes methods to get/set attributes and automatically updates timestamps on creation/modification using Objectify annotations for Google Cloud Datastore persistence.
