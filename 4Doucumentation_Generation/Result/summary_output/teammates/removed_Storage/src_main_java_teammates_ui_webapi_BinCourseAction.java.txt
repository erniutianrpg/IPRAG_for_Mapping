This code defines a `BinCourseAction` class that moves a course to the recycle bin. It checks if the user is an authorized instructor, verifies access control, and then moves the specified course to the recycle bin by updating its deletion timestamp. The course ID is taken from the request parameters. If successful, it returns the course data; if the course doesn't exist, it throws an `EntityNotFoundException`. The action requires the user to be logged in as an instructor with course modification privileges.
