1. Retrieve questions by ID, session-course-number combo, or for entire sessions
2. Filter questions by participant type (giver)
3. Update questions with validation checks
4. Delete single questions or batches via queries
5. Check for existing questions
It uses Objectify for datastore operations and converts between entity objects and transferable attributes. The class follows a singleton pattern and includes input validation.
