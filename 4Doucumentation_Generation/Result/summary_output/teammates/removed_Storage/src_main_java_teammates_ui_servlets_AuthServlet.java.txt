The `AuthServlet` is an abstract base class for handling OAuth2 authentication in a Java web application. It provides methods for:  
1. Setting up Google OAuth2 authorization flow with email scope  
2. Generating redirect URIs for OAuth callbacks  
3. Creating/removing authentication cookies (with encryption for user info)  
4. Managing authentication state (next URL and session ID)  
The servlet uses Google's OAuth2 client library and handles both cookie management and OAuth configuration.
