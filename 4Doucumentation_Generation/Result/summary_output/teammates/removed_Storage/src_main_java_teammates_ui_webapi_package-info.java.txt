This code defines a Java package named `teammates.ui.webapi` that serves as the API layer for processing logic in the application. It contains action classes responsible for handling web API requests and implementing the corresponding business logic. The package acts as the intermediary between the frontend interface and backend systems, processing incoming requests and returning appropriate responses.
