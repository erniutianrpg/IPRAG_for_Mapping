This code defines an enum `InstructorPermissionRole` representing different instructor roles in a system (Co-owner, Manager, Observer, Tutor, Custom). Each role is associated with a string name from `Const.InstructorPermissionRoleNames`. The enum provides methods to get the role name and convert a string to the corresponding enum value, defaulting to Custom for unknown strings. (98 words)
