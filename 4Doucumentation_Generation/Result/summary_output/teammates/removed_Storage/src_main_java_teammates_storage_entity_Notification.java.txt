This code defines a `Notification` entity class for a system, representing notifications with properties like ID, timing (start/end), style, target user, title, message, and visibility status. It includes constructors for creating new notifications (with auto-generated IDs and timestamps) or reconstructing existing ones, along with getters/setters for all fields. The `@OnSave` annotation ensures the `updatedAt` timestamp is refreshed whenever the entity is saved. The class is designed for persistence using Objectify with Google Cloud Datastore.
