The `SendErrorReportAction` class is a web API endpoint that allows any user (even non-logged-in) to submit error reports. It accepts an error report request, logs it as a severe error (which triggers an email to system admins), and returns a success message. The report includes user info (or "Non-logged in user"), request ID, subject, and content. No special permissions are required to use this endpoint.
