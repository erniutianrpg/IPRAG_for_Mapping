This code implements a search manager for account requests using Apache Solr. It provides functionality to:  
1. Create search documents from account request attributes  
2. Retrieve account requests from Solr documents  
3. Sort results by creation date (newest first)  
4. Perform searches with a query string  
5. Convert search results back to account request attributes  

The class acts as a bridge between the application's account request data and Solr search operations, using `AccountRequestsDb` for database interactions.
