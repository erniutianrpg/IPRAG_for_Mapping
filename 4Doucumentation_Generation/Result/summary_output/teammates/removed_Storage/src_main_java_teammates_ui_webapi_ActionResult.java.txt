The `ActionResult` abstract class represents the outcome of executing an `Action` in a web API. It stores an HTTP status code and provides a method (`send`) to forward the result to an HTTP response. Subclasses must implement `send` to handle specific response packaging. The `getStatusCode` method allows accessing the stored status code. This serves as a base for different types of action results in a web application. (98 words)
