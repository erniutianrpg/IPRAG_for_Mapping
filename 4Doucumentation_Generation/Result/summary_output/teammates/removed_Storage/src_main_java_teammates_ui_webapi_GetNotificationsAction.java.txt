This code handles fetching notifications for users in a system. Key functionalities:
1. Checks user authorization - admins can access all notifications, while students/instructors can only access their respective notifications.
2. Retrieves notifications either for all users (admin-only) or for a specific target user (student/instructor).
3. Filters unread notifications for non-admin users and marks them as "shown".
4. Returns the notifications in JSON format, either all or just unread ones based on request parameters.

The code includes proper validation and error handling for invalid parameters or unauthorized access.
