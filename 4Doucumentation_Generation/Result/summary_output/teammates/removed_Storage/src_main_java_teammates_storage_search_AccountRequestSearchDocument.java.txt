This code defines a `AccountRequestSearchDocument` class that creates searchable documents for account requests. It extracts key fields (name, email, institute) from an `AccountRequestAttributes` object and formats them into a map with searchable fields. The map includes: a unique ID (email%institute), a concatenated text field for searching, and individual fields for email and institute. This enables efficient indexing and searching of account requests in a search engine.
