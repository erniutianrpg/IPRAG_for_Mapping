The `FeedbackResponsesDb` class handles CRUD operations for feedback responses in a database. It provides methods to:
- Get responses by question, session, giver, or receiver
- Check for existing responses
- Update or delete responses
- Filter responses by sections or courses
- Count responses within a time range
- Manage response entities using Objectify for Google Datastore

The class acts as a data access layer between the application and the database, converting between entity objects and attributes while enforcing data validity.
