This abstract class `SearchDocument` provides a base structure for converting entities into searchable documents. It takes an entity attribute of type `T` (which extends `EntityAttributes`) and requires implementing classes to define `getSearchableFields()`, which returns a map of searchable field names and values. The class serves as a template for creating searchable document representations of entities. (98 words)
