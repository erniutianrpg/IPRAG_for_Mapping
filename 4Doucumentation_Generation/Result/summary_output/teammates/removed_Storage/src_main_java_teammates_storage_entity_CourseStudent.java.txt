This code defines a `CourseStudent` entity class representing a student enrolled in a course. It stores student details like email, name, Google ID, comments, course ID, team, and section. The class includes methods to generate unique IDs and registration keys, track creation/update timestamps, and handle data validation (trimming strings). It's designed for persistence using Objectify with annotations for indexing and translation of Instant fields. The entity links students to courses and accounts (via Google ID).
