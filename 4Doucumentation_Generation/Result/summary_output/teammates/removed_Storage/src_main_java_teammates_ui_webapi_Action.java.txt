The `Action` class is an abstract base class for handling HTTP requests in a web API. It provides common functionality for authentication, authorization, request parameter handling, and request body processing. Key features include:

1. Initializes user authentication info (regular, admin, or masqueraded users)
2. Performs access control checks based on user privileges
3. Provides helper methods to retrieve and validate request parameters
4. Handles request body parsing and validation
5. Supports both registered and unregistered users (students/instructors)
6. Defines abstract methods for concrete actions to implement specific authorization and execution logic

The class serves as a foundation for specific API actions, handling common concerns while allowing subclasses to define action-specific behavior.
