This code defines a Java package named `teammates.main` that serves as the entry point to the system. The package contains a single class (not shown in the snippet) which acts as the main starting point for the application. The comment indicates this class is responsible for initializing and launching the system. The package structure suggests it's part of a larger codebase called "teammates" (likely an educational or collaboration tool). In under 100 words, this is the core system entry point package.
