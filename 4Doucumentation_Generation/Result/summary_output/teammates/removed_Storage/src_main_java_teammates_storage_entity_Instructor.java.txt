The `Instructor` class represents an instructor's association with a course in a database. It stores details like Google ID, course ID, name, email, role, display preferences, and privileges. The entity generates a unique ID (email%courseId) and registration key, tracks creation/update timestamps, and manages archival status. It uses Objectify annotations for database operations, including automatic timestamp updates on save.
