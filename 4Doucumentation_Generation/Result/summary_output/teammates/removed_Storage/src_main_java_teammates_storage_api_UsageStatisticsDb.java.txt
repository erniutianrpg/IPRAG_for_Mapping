The `UsageStatisticsDb` class manages CRUD operations for system usage statistics stored in a database (using Objectify). It provides methods to retrieve statistics within a specified time range (`getUsageStatisticsForTimeRange`), check for existing entries (`hasExistingEntities`), and convert entities to attributes (`makeAttributes`). The class follows a singleton pattern with a private constructor and a static `inst()` method for access. It extends `EntitiesDb`, a base class for database operations, and works with `UsageStatistics` entities and `UsageStatisticsAttributes` data transfer objects.
