This code creates a new instructor account with sample demo courses in a learning management system. It validates a registration key, sets a default timezone if needed, and checks if the account request exists and is unused. It then generates a demo course ID, imports sample course data adjusted for the instructor's timezone, and enrolls the instructor. Finally, it marks the account request as registered. The demo course ID is generated from the instructor's email, ensuring uniqueness by appending numbers if needed.
