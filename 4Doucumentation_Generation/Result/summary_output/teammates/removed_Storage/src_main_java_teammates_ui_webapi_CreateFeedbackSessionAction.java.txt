This code creates a feedback session in a course. It validates session timing parameters, checks instructor permissions, and creates a new feedback session with specified attributes (name, timing, visibility, etc.). If requested, it copies questions from an existing session. The created session data, along with instructor privileges, is returned as JSON. Error handling includes checks for invalid parameters, duplicate sessions, and permission violations.
