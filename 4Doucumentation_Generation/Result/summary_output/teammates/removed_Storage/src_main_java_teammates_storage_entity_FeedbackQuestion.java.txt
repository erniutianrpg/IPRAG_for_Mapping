This code defines a `FeedbackQuestion` entity class for a feedback system, representing questions in feedback sessions. It stores question details like ID, session name, course ID, question text/description/number/type, participant types (giver/recipient), visibility settings (who can see responses/names), and timestamps (created/updated). The class includes getters/setters and handles legacy ID compatibility. The `@OnSave` annotation updates the timestamp automatically when saved.
