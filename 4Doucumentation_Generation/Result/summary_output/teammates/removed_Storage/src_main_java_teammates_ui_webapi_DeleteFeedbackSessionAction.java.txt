This code defines a `DeleteFeedbackSessionAction` class that handles deleting a feedback session from a course. It verifies the user is logged in and has instructor-level permissions to modify sessions. The action takes `courseId` and `feedbackSessionName` as parameters, checks access control, then permanently deletes the specified feedback session using `logic.deleteFeedbackSessionCascade()`. Finally, it returns a success message confirming the deletion.
