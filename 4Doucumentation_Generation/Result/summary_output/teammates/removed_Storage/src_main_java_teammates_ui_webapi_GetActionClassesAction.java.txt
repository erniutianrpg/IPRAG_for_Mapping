This code defines a `GetActionClassesAction` class that retrieves a list of action class names. It requires the user to be logged in as either a Maintainer or Admin for access. The `execute()` method collects all action class names from `ActionFactory.ACTION_MAPPINGS`, converts them to simple class names, and returns them as JSON output wrapped in an `ActionClasses` object. Essentially, it's an API endpoint that provides metadata about available actions to authorized users.
