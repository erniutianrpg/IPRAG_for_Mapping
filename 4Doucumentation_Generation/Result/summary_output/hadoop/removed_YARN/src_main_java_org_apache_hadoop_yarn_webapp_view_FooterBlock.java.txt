This code defines a `FooterBlock` class that extends `HtmlBlock` to render a simple footer in HTML. The footer contains a hyperlink labeled "About Apache Hadoop" that points to the Hadoop website. The footer is styled with CSS classes `#footer` and `ui-widget`. The class uses a fluent-style API to construct the HTML elements.
