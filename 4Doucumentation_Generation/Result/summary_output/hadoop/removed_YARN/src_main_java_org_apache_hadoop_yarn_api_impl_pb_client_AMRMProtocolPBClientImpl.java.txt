This code implements a Protocol Buffers (PB) based client for Hadoop YARN's AMRMProtocol, which handles communication between Application Masters and ResourceManager. It provides three main RPC methods: `allocate()` for resource requests, `finishApplicationMaster()` for cleanup, and `registerApplicationMaster()` for initialization. The client converts PB request/response objects and handles remote exceptions, using Hadoop RPC with ProtoOverHadoopRpcEngine for communication.
