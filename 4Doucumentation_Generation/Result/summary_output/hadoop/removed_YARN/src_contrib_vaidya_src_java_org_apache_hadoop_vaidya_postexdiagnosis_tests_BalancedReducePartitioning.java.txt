This code implements a diagnostic test called `BalancedReducePartitioning` that evaluates whether reduce tasks in a Hadoop job are evenly balanced. It calculates an impact score (0-1) based on how many reducers process 90% (default) of total records - fewer busy reducers indicate poor balancing. The test returns recommendations for improving partitioning, like using `KeyFieldBasedPartitioner` for streaming jobs. The impact score reflects the potential performance gain from better load balancing (1 = maximum improvement possible). For map-only jobs, impact is always 0.
