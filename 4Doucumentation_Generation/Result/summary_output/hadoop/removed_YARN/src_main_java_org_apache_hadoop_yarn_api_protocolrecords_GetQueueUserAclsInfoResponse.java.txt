This code defines a response interface (`GetQueueUserAclsInfoResponse`) in Hadoop YARN's API for querying queue access control lists (ACLs) for a user. It provides methods to get and set a list of `QueueUserACLInfo` objects, which describe the user's permissions (`QueueACL`) for each queue. The interface is marked as public and stable for the getter, while the setter is private and unstable, indicating it's for internal use and may change.
