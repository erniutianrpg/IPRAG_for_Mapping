The `DeepCompare` interface defines a method for performing deep equality comparisons between objects. Implementations must compare all semantically significant fields of an object with another instance. If any differences are found, they throw a `DeepInequalityException` with a chain of causes describing the path to the mismatched field. The `myLocation` parameter tracks the field path during recursive comparison. This is used for detailed error reporting rather than simple boolean equality checks.
