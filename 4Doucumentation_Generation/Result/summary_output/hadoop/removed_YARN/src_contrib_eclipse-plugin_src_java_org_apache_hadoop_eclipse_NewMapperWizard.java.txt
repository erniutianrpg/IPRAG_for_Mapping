This code implements an Eclipse wizard for creating a new Hadoop Mapper class. The wizard provides a template for the Map portion of a MapReduce job, automatically setting up the required superclass (`MapReduceBase`) and interface (`Mapper`), and generating a stub `map()` method with the correct signature. The wizard includes UI controls for package, class name, and inheritance settings, and validates user input before creating the new Java file.
