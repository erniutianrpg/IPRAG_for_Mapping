This code parses Hadoop job configuration XML files to extract key parameters like heap size, queue name, job name, memory allocations (map/reduce), and job ID. It processes the XML structure, validates the configuration, and stores properties in a `Properties` object. The class uses regex patterns to extract specific values (e.g., heap size from JVM options) and handles parsing errors by marking the configuration as invalid. Extracted values include cluster-wide and job-specific memory settings.
