This code implements a YARN client for submitting and managing a Distributed Shell application. The client allows users to submit a shell command to be executed across multiple containers in a YARN cluster. Key functionalities include:

1. Parsing command-line arguments for application configuration
2. Connecting to the YARN ResourceManager
3. Requesting a new application ID
4. Setting up the ApplicationMaster container with required resources and environment
5. Submitting the application to YARN
6. Monitoring the application status until completion or timeout
7. Handling application cleanup/kill if needed

The client serves as an example of how to build YARN applications, demonstrating interactions with the ResourceManager and proper resource management for distributed applications.
