This code defines the `AMResponse` interface in Hadoop YARN, which represents the ResourceManager's response to an ApplicationMaster's resource allocation request. It includes methods to check if the ApplicationMaster should reboot, track response IDs, get newly allocated containers, view available cluster resources, and check completed container statuses. The interface serves as a communication mechanism between the ResourceManager and ApplicationMaster during resource negotiation.
