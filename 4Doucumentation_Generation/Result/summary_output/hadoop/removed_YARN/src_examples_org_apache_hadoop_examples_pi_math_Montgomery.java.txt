This code implements Montgomery multiplication, an efficient algorithm for modular arithmetic on large numbers without division. The `Montgomery` class:

1. Initializes parameters (N, R, N_I, etc.) for Montgomery reduction when `set()` is called with an odd modulus N
2. Provides a `mod()` method to compute 2^y mod N efficiently using Montgomery multiplication
3. Uses an inner `Product` class to perform the core Montgomery multiplication operation (m()), which:
   - Multiplies two numbers in Montgomery form
   - Reduces the result using bit shifts instead of division
   - Returns the result in standard form

The implementation avoids costly division operations by using bitwise operations and precomputed constants.
