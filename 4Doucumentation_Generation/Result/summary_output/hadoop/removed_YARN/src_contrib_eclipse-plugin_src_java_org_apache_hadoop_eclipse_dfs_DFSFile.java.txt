This code implements file handling operations for a Hadoop Distributed File System (DFS) within an Eclipse plugin. It provides functionality to:
1. Upload local files to DFS
2. Download files from DFS to local storage
3. Open and view DFS file contents
4. Manage file metadata (size, replication)
5. Integrate with Eclipse's UI for progress monitoring and file editing

The class extends basic DFS path functionality with file-specific operations and implements Eclipse's IStorage interface for editor integration.
