This code handles the launch and cleanup of Application Masters (AMs) in Hadoop YARN. The `AMLauncher` class implements `Runnable` and performs two main operations based on the event type: 

1. **Launch**: Sets up the AM container by creating a launch context with necessary tokens, environment variables, and security credentials, then starts the container via the ContainerManager.
2. **Cleanup**: Stops the AM container if needed. 

It handles security (like token generation) and communicates with the NodeManager to manage the AM container lifecycle. Errors are reported back via event handlers.
