This code is a Java implementation of a HTML generator called Hamlet. It provides a fluent interface for programmatically generating HTML documents with proper structure and attributes. The code defines classes for all major HTML elements (like HTML, HEAD, BODY, TABLE, FORM, etc.) with methods to set attributes and content. It handles nesting of elements, attributes, and text content while maintaining proper HTML syntax. The generator supports HTML4/XHTML features and produces well-formed markup.
