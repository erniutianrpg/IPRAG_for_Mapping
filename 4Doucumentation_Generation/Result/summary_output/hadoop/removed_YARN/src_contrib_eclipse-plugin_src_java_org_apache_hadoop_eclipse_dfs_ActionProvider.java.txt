This code provides action handlers for a Hadoop Distributed File System (DFS) browser in Eclipse. It enables operations like delete, refresh, open, download, upload, create directory, reconnect, and disconnect on DFS elements (files, folders, locations). The actions are added to context menus and action bars based on the selected item type (single or multiple selections). The `DFSAction` class handles the execution of these actions by delegating to `DFSActionImpl`.
