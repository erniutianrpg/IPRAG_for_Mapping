This code defines an enumeration `ContainerState` that represents the various lifecycle states of a container in Apache Hadoop YARN's NodeManager. The states include initialization (NEW), resource localization (LOCALIZING, LOCALIZED, LOCALIZATION_FAILED), execution (RUNNING), termination (EXITED_WITH_SUCCESS, EXITED_WITH_FAILURE, KILLING), cleanup (CONTAINER_CLEANEDUP_AFTER_KILL, CONTAINER_RESOURCES_CLEANINGUP), and completion (DONE). It tracks a container's progression from creation to final cleanup.
