This code implements a Protocol Buffers (PB) based request for getting YARN queue information. It provides methods to get/set a queue name, and flags for including applications, child queues, and recursive queries. The class `GetQueueInfoRequestPBImpl` converts between PB protocol and Java objects, handling default values and null checks. It extends `ProtoBase` to manage PB serialization/deserialization.
