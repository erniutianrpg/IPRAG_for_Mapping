The `IJobListener` interface defines callback methods for monitoring Hadoop MapReduce jobs in a server view. It provides methods to handle job changes (`jobChanged`), additions (`jobAdded`), and removals (`jobRemoved`), as well as tracking the start (`publishStart`) and completion (`publishDone`) of publishing JAR modules. This interface enables real-time updates and management of Hadoop jobs within an Eclipse plugin environment. (60 words)
