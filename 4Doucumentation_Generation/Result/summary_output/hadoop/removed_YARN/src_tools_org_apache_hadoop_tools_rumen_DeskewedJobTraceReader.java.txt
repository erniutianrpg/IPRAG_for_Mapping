The `DeskewedJobTraceReader` class reads job trace data while handling out-of-order job submissions. It maintains a buffer (`skewBuffer`) to reorder jobs based on their submit times, ensuring chronological output. The class tracks repeated submit times, measures skew (out-of-order jobs), and can either abort or continue processing when unfixable skew is detected. The buffer size is configurable, and the class reports the maximum skew buffer needed. It wraps a `JobTraceReader` and implements `Closeable` for resource management.
