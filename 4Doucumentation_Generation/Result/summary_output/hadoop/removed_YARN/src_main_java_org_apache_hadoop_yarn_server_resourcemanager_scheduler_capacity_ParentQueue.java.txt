This code implements a `ParentQueue` class for Hadoop YARN's Capacity Scheduler, which manages hierarchical queues for resource allocation. Key functionalities include:

1. Queue hierarchy management with parent-child relationships
2. Capacity configuration (minimum/maximum capacity, absolute capacity)
3. Resource allocation tracking and utilization metrics
4. ACL-based access control for queues
5. Application lifecycle management (submit/finish/remove)
6. Container assignment to child queues based on utilization
7. Dynamic queue reconfiguration
8. Resource calculation and bookkeeping

The class maintains queue state, metrics, and child queues while enforcing capacity limits and access controls. It handles container assignments by distributing resources to under-utilized child queues.
