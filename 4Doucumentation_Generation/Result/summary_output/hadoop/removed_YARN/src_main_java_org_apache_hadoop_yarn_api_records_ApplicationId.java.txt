This code defines an abstract `ApplicationId` class that represents a globally unique identifier for applications in Hadoop YARN. The ID combines a cluster timestamp (ResourceManager start time) with a monotonically increasing counter. The class provides methods to get/set these values, implements comparison, equality checks, and hash code generation, and formats the ID as a string (e.g., "application_123456789_0001"). The ID ensures uniqueness across all applications managed by a ResourceManager instance.
