This code implements a wizard for configuring Hadoop server locations in Eclipse. The `HadoopLocationWizard` class provides a UI with three tabs (General, Tunneling, and Advanced) to edit Hadoop server properties like:

1. General settings (location name, job tracker host/port, name node host/port)
2. SOCKS proxy configuration
3. Advanced Hadoop parameters

Key functionality:
- Creates/edits Hadoop server configurations
- Validates input (hostnames, ports, URIs)
- Maintains dependencies between related properties
- Supports loading from existing configurations
- Uses SWT for the Eclipse UI components

The wizard handles both new server creation and editing existing configurations, with validation to ensure proper configuration before saving.
