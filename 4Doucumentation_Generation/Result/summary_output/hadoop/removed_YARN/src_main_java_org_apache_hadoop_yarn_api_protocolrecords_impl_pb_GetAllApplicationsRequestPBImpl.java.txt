This code is a Protocol Buffers (PB) implementation class for `GetAllApplicationsRequest` in Hadoop YARN. It provides methods to construct and retrieve a protocol buffer message (`GetAllApplicationsRequestProto`) that requests all YARN applications. The class handles conversion between PB objects and Java objects, maintaining state via `viaProto` flag to track whether the underlying data comes from a proto or a builder. It extends `ProtoBase` for basic proto functionality. (98 words)
