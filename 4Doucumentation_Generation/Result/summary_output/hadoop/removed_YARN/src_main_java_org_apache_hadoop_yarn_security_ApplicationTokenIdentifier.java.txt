This code defines an `ApplicationTokenIdentifier` class for Hadoop YARN, which represents a security token identifier for application attempts. It extends `TokenIdentifier` and includes functionality to serialize/deserialize the token (via `write` and `readFields`), specify the token kind (`YARN_APPLICATION_TOKEN`), and retrieve user information. A nested `Renewer` class handles token renewal. The token stores an `applicationAttemptId` to identify the YARN application attempt.
