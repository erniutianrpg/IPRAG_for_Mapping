This code implements a Protocol Buffers (PB) based class `GetQueueInfoResponsePBImpl` for handling YARN queue information responses. It converts between Java objects and Protocol Buffer messages, allowing retrieval and setting of queue information (`QueueInfo`). The class manages proto message building, merging local changes to the proto format, and provides methods to get/set queue details while handling proto conversions internally. It extends `ProtoBase` for PB functionality.
