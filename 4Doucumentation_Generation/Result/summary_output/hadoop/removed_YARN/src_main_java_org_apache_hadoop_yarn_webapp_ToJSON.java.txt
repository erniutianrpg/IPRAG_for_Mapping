The code defines a simple Java interface `ToJSON` that provides a lightweight method for JSON rendering. The interface contains a single method `toJSON(PrintWriter out)` which takes a `PrintWriter` as input, allowing implementing classes to write their JSON representation to the specified output stream. This enables objects to serialize themselves to JSON format. (Words: 50)
