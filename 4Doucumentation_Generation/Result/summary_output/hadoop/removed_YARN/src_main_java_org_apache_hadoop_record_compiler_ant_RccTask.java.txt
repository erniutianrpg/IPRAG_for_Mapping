The `RccTask` class is an Ant task for compiling Hadoop record definition files (.jr) into Java or C++ code. It accepts either a single file or a fileset, with configurable options for output language (default: Java), destination directory (default: current dir), and error handling. The task processes each file by invoking Hadoop's record compiler (`Rcc.driver`). If compilation fails and `failonerror` is true (default), it throws a `BuildException`. This class is deprecated in favor of Avro.
