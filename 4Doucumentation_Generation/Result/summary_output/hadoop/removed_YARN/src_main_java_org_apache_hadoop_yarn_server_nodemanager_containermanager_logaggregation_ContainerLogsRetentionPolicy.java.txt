This code defines an enum `ContainerLogsRetentionPolicy` that specifies three log retention policies for YARN containers: 
1. `APPLICATION_MASTER_ONLY` - keep only Application Master logs
2. `AM_AND_FAILED_CONTAINERS_ONLY` - keep Application Master and failed container logs
3. `ALL_CONTAINERS` - retain logs for all containers. 
It controls which container logs are preserved after application completion. (60 words)
