This code provides utility methods to detect if the current execution is running within a unit test environment. It checks the stack trace for JUnit or Maven Surefire test frameworks, setting flags `isUnitTest` and `isJUnitTest` accordingly. The detection only runs once (lazy initialization) and results are cached for subsequent calls to `isUnitTest()` and `isJUnitTest()`.
