The `JobStoryProducer` interface defines a producer that sequentially generates `JobStory` objects. It extends `Closeable` for resource management and includes a single method `getNextJob()` that returns the next job in the sequence or `null` if no more jobs are available, potentially throwing an `IOException`. This interface is part of the Hadoop Rumen toolkit for processing job history data. (Words: 58)
