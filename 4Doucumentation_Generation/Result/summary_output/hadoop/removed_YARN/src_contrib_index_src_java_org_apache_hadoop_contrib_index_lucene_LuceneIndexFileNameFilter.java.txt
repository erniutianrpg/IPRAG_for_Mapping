This code implements a Hadoop `PathFilter` wrapper around Lucene's `IndexFileNameFilter`. It converts Lucene's filename filter (which checks valid index files) to work with Hadoop's `Path` objects. The class provides a singleton instance and delegates the filtering logic to Lucene's built-in filter, checking if a given Hadoop `Path` represents a valid Lucene index file. Essentially, it bridges Lucene's file filtering functionality to work within Hadoop's filesystem operations. (98 words)
