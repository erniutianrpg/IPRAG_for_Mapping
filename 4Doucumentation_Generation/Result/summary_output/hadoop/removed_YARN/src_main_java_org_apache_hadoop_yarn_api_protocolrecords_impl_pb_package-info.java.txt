This code defines a private package (`org.apache.hadoop.yarn.api.protocolrecords.impl.pb`) for Protocol Buffer (PB) implementations of YARN API protocol records. The `@InterfaceAudience.Private` annotation indicates that this package is intended for internal Hadoop/YARN use only, not for public consumption. The code includes standard Apache License 2.0 boilerplate but doesn't contain any functional implementation - it's just a package declaration with necessary imports for internal Hadoop infrastructure.
