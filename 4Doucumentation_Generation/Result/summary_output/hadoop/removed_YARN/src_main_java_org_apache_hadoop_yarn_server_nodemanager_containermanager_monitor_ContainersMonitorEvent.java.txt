The code defines a `ContainersMonitorEvent` class that extends `AbstractEvent` to represent container monitoring events in YARN's NodeManager. It includes a `ContainerId` to identify the container involved and an event type (defined by `ContainersMonitorEventType`). The class provides a constructor to initialize these fields and a getter method for the container ID. This event is used for communication within the container monitoring system. (98 words)
