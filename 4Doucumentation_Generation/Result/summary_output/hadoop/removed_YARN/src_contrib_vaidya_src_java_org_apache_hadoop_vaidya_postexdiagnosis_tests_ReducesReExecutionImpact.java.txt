This code defines a diagnostic test `ReducesReExecutionImpact` that evaluates the impact of re-executed reduce tasks in a Hadoop job. It calculates the percentage of reduce tasks that were re-executed by comparing launched vs. total reduce tasks. For map-only jobs, impact is 0. The test provides prescription advice about potential causes (unstable nodes or application failures) and reference details including statistics about reduce task execution. The impact score represents the proportion of re-executed tasks.
