The `ClientToAMSecretManager` class manages secret keys for secure client-to-Application Master (AM) communication in Hadoop YARN. It maintains a map of application-specific master keys, generates passwords for client tokens, and validates them. Key functionalities include setting/retrieving master keys, creating/validating passwords using these keys, and generating unique client token identifiers. The class extends Hadoop's `SecretManager` to handle client token security.
