This code implements a Hadoop `OutputFormat` for loading reducer output into Vertica, a columnar database. It provides methods to configure output tables (including table creation/dropping), validates output specifications, and writes records to Vertica using COPY commands. The class also includes an `optimize()` method to improve performance for newly loaded tables by creating and deploying optimized projections. The output uses delimiters and record terminators for data formatting.
