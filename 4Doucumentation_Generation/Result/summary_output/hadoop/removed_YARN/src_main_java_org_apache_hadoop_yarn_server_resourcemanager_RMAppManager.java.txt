The `RMAppManager` class manages applications in Hadoop YARN's ResourceManager. It handles application submission, completion, and lifecycle events. Key functions include:

1. Submitting applications with proper credentials and sanity checks
2. Tracking completed applications and enforcing retention limits
3. Logging application summaries and audit events
4. Managing application ACLs and security tokens
5. Processing application events (submit/completed) via event handler

It maintains completed applications up to a configurable maximum and integrates with other RM components like scheduler, ACL manager, and token renewer.
