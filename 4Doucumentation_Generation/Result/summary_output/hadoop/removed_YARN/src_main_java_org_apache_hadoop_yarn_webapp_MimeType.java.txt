This code defines a Java interface `MimeType` that declares constant strings representing common MIME types with UTF-8 character encoding. The MIME types include plain text, HTML, XML, HTTP, and JSON formats. These constants can be used throughout the application to standardize content type headers in web responses. The interface serves as a centralized location for these commonly used content type definitions. (58 words)
