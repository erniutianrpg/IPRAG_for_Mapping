This code defines a web page (`NodePage`) for displaying NodeManager information in Apache Hadoop YARN. The page shows resource allocation (virtual and physical memory), node health status, last health check time, health report, and version information for both NodeManager and Hadoop. The `NodeBlock` class renders this information in an HTML block using an accordion UI layout. The data comes from the NodeManager's context and resource view components.
