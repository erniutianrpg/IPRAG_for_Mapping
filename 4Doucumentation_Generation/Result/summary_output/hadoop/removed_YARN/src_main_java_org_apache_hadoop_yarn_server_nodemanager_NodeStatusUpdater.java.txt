The code defines a `NodeStatusUpdater` interface that extends the `Service` interface, intended for use in Hadoop YARN's NodeManager. It provides two key functions: `getRMNMSharedSecret()` retrieves a shared secret for secure communication between the ResourceManager and NodeManager, and `sendOutofBandHeartBeat()` allows sending an immediate heartbeat to the ResourceManager outside the regular schedule. This interface facilitates status updates and secure coordination between YARN components. (94 words)
