The `SummationWritable` class is a Hadoop `WritableComparable` implementation that serializes and deserializes `Summation` objects (mathematical summations) for distributed computation. It handles reading/writing summation data (including arithmetic progressions for terms and values) to/from `DataInput`/`DataOutput`, stores the summation in a configuration, and provides comparison functionality. The class also includes helper methods for serializing `ArithmeticProgression` components. It's primarily used for parallel computation of mathematical series in Hadoop.
