This code implements a web interface for viewing container information in Hadoop YARN's Node Manager. The `ContainerPage` class displays details about a specific container, including its ID, state, exit status, diagnostics, user, memory requirements, and log links. If the container is invalid or not found, it shows an appropriate error message. The page uses HTML blocks and jQuery UI for rendering. The `ContainerBlock` class fetches container data from the Node Manager context and formats it for display.
