This code implements a Protocol Buffers (PB) service interface for Hadoop YARN's Resource Manager Admin Protocol (RMAdminProtocol). It acts as an adapter between PB-based RPC calls and the actual RMAdminProtocol implementation, converting PB request/response objects to/from Java objects. The service handles administrative operations like refreshing queues, nodes, ACLs, user-group mappings, and superuser configurations, translating any YARN exceptions into ServiceExceptions for the RPC layer.
