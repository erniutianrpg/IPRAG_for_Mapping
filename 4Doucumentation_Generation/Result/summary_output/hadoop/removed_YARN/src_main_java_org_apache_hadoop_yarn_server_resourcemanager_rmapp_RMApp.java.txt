The `RMApp` interface defines the read-only operations for managing applications in Apache Hadoop YARN's ResourceManager. It provides methods to access application details like ID, state, user, progress, queue, name, and tracking URL. It also handles application attempts (`RMAppAttempt`), stores application metadata, and reports status via `ApplicationReport`. Additionally, it tracks timing information (submit, start, finish times) and diagnostics, while managing the application's final status. Essentially, it serves as the central interface for querying application state and metadata in YARN.
