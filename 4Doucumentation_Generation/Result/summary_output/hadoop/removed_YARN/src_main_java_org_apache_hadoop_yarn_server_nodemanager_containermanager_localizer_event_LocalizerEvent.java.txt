This code defines a `LocalizerEvent` class that extends `AbstractEvent` for the `ResourceLocalizationService` in Hadoop YARN. It represents events used for resource localization, containing an event type (from `LocalizerEventType`) and a `localizerId` string to identify the localizer. The class provides a constructor to create events and a getter method to retrieve the `localizerId`. Essentially, it facilitates communication within the resource localization process. (98 words)
