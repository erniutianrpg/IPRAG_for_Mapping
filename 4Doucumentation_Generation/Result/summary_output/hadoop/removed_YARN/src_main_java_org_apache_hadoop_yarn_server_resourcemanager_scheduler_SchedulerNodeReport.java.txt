The `SchedulerNodeReport` class provides a snapshot of a node's resource usage in a YARN cluster. It tracks three key metrics: currently used resources (`used`), available resources (`avail`), and the number of running containers (`num`). The class is initialized with data from a `SchedulerNode` and offers getter methods to access these metrics. This report helps monitor node utilization in the resource scheduler. (98 words)
