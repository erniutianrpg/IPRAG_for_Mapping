The `ErrorPage` class generates a user-friendly HTML error page for YARN web applications. It displays the error status code, a reference to HTTP error codes, and detailed error information. If available, it shows either custom error details or a truncated stack trace (up to 64KB) of the exception. The page uses jQuery UI for styling and includes YARN's CSS. The layout features an accordion-style display with error titles and details sections.
