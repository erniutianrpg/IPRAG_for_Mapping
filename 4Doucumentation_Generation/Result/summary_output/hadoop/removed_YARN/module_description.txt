This module is a comprehensive implementation of Apache Hadoop YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator), providing the core infrastructure for distributed resource management and job scheduling in a Hadoop cluster. It encompasses the ResourceManager for centralized cluster resource allocation, NodeManager for per-node resource management, and ApplicationMaster for application-specific task coordination. The module includes protocols for communication between these components, security mechanisms for authentication and authorization, web interfaces for monitoring, and utilities for state management, logging, and diagnostics. It supports various scheduling policies (like Capacity Scheduler) and handles the complete lifecycle of distributed applications from submission to completion, including resource localization, container execution, and log aggregation. The implementation leverages Protocol Buffers for efficient RPC communication and provides extensive APIs for cluster administration and application development.
