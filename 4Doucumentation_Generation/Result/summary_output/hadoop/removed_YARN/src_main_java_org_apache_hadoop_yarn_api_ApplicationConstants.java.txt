This code defines constants and environment variables used in YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) applications within the Hadoop ecosystem. It provides:

1. Environment variable names for application tokens, container IDs, NodeManager details, and submission times
2. Standard paths for logs (stdout/stderr) and directories
3. A default application classpath configuration
4. An enum (`Environment`) listing system environment variables (some modifiable, some final) including user info, paths, and Hadoop/YARN home directories

The interface serves as a central reference for environment-related constants needed by YARN applications and containers.
