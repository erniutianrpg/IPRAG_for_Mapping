The `VerticaRecordReader` class is a Hadoop MapReduce `RecordReader` implementation that reads data from a Vertica database. It processes query results from a `VerticaInputSplit`, converting each row into a key-value pair where the key is a `LongWritable` (position offset) and the value is a `VerticaRecord` (database row). It handles query execution, progress tracking, and resource cleanup. The class manages cursor position, tracks progress, and provides methods for iterating through result sets while converting SQL exceptions to IOExceptions for Hadoop compatibility.
