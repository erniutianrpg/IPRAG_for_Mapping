This code defines the `AMRMProtocol` interface in Hadoop YARN, which specifies the communication protocol between an ApplicationMaster and the ResourceManager. It includes three main methods: `registerApplicationMaster` for initial registration, `finishApplicationMaster` for deregistration upon completion, and `allocate` for requesting resources and heartbeating. The interface enables the ApplicationMaster to request cluster resources, report status, and maintain its lifecycle with the ResourceManager. (98 words)
