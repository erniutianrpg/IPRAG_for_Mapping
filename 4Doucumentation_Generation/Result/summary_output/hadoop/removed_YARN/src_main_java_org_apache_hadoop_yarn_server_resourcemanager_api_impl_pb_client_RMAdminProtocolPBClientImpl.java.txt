This code implements a Protocol Buffer (PB) client for the YARN Resource Manager Admin Protocol (RMAdminProtocol). It provides methods to refresh various configurations in the ResourceManager, including queues, nodes, superuser groups, user-group mappings, admin ACLs, and service ACLs. The client converts PB request/response objects to/from protocol records and handles RPC communication with the ResourceManager, propagating any errors encountered during the process.
