This code is a Protocol Buffers (PB) implementation of the `ApplicationReport` interface in Apache Hadoop YARN. It provides getters and setters for application metadata (ID, name, queue, user), status (state, diagnostics), resource usage, tracking URLs, timings, and final status. The class handles conversion between PB and Java formats while maintaining a builder pattern for constructing protobuf messages. It serves as a bridge between YARN's Java API and its protobuf-based wire protocol.
