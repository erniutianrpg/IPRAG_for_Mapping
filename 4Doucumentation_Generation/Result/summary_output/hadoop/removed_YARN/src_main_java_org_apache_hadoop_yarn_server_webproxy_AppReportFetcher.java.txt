The `AppReportFetcher` class fetches application reports from YARN's ResourceManager (RM). It establishes a connection to the RM using RPC and provides a method `getApplicationReport()` to retrieve reports for specific applications by their `ApplicationId`. It supports both remote RM connections and direct access when running within the RM. The class handles configuration and network setup internally.
