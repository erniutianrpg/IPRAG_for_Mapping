The code defines a `ContainerEvent` class that extends `AbstractEvent` to represent container-related events in a YARN NodeManager. It stores a `ContainerId` and an event type (from `ContainerEventType` enum), allowing the system to track and handle container lifecycle events (like creation, start, stop) with associated container identifiers. The class provides a getter method to retrieve the container ID. (94 words)
