This code implements a Protocol Buffers (PB) based `AllocateResponse` class for Hadoop YARN, which handles resource allocation responses from the ResourceManager to ApplicationMasters. It provides methods to get/set an `AMResponse` (ApplicationMaster response) and converts between PB and Java formats. The class manages proto serialization/deserialization while maintaining a local cache of the `AMResponse` object for efficiency.
