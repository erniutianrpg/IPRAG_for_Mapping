This code defines an abstract `Resource` class in Hadoop YARN that models cluster resources (currently only memory). It provides getter/setter methods for memory, along with standard `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` implementations. The class is marked as stable public API, allowing applications to request resources for tasks. It implements `Comparable` for resource comparison.
