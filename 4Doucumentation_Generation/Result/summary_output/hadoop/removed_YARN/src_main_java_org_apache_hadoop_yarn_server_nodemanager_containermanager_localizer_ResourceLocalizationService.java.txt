The `ResourceLocalizationService` manages the localization (downloading and caching) of resources needed by containers running on a NodeManager in a Hadoop YARN cluster. Key functionalities include:

1. Initializes and manages directories for public, private, and application-specific resources
2. Handles resource requests from containers and tracks resource states
3. Spawns `ContainerLocalizer` processes to download resources securely
4. Manages resource lifecycle including cleanup when containers/applications complete
5. Implements cache management with periodic cleanup based on size limits
6. Provides RPC interface for localizers to communicate status updates

The service coordinates with other NodeManager components via events to ensure resources are available before container launch and cleaned up after completion.
