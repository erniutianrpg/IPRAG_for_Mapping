The `InfoBlock` class generates an HTML table displaying key-value pairs from a `ResponseInfo` object. It creates a responsive table with alternating row colors, where each row shows an item's key and value. If an item has an associated URL, the value is rendered as a clickable link. The table is wrapped in a div for styling and includes a header with information about the content. This is typically used in web interfaces to display configuration or system information.
