The `LoggedTask` class represents a Hadoop task within a job, tracking its attempts, I/O metrics (bytes/records), runtime (start/finish times), type (map/reduce), status, and preferred locations. It provides methods to adjust timestamps, incorporate counter metrics, and compare task details deeply. The class also handles unknown JSON attributes gracefully and maintains task attempt history. Essentially, it's a data container for Hadoop task information with serialization/deserialization support.
