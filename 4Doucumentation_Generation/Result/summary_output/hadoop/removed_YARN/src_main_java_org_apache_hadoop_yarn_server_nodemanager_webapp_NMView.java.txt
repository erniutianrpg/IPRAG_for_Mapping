This code defines a web view (`NMView`) for the Node Manager in Hadoop YARN, extending a two-column layout. It sets up page metadata to auto-refresh every 10 seconds and configures UI elements like an accordion menu for navigation and a theme switcher. The navigation block is specified by the `NavBlock` class. Essentially, it provides the structural and stylistic foundation for the Node Manager's web interface.
