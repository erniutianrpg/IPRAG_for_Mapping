This code defines the `GetContainerStatusResponse` interface in Hadoop YARN, which represents the response from a NodeManager to an ApplicationMaster requesting a container's status. It provides methods to get and set the `ContainerStatus` of a container, with annotations indicating public/private and stable/unstable API classifications. The interface is part of YARN's container management protocol.
