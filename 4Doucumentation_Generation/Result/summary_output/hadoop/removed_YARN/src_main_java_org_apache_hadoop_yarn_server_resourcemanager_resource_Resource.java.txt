This code defines a `Resource` class for Apache Hadoop YARN that represents and manages compute resources (specifically memory). It provides static utility methods to:
1. Create resources with specified memory
2. Add/subtract resources
3. Compare resources (equals, less/greater than operations)
All operations are memory-based. The class is marked as private and evolving for internal YARN use.
