This code defines an `RMAppAttemptRegistrationEvent` class in Hadoop YARN, which represents an event when a YARN application attempt registers with the ResourceManager. It stores registration details including the application attempt ID, host, RPC port, and tracking URL. The class extends `RMAppAttemptEvent` and provides getter methods to access these registration details. The event type is set to `REGISTERED` when instantiated.
