This code defines a `HeartbeatResponse` interface in Apache Hadoop YARN for communication between NodeManagers and ResourceManager. It provides methods to:
1. Track response IDs and node actions
2. Manage lists of containers and applications to clean up (add, remove, clear)
3. Get counts and individual items from cleanup lists
The interface serves as a protocol for the ResourceManager to instruct NodeManagers on which containers/applications to terminate and what actions to take.
