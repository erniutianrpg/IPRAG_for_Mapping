The `ContainerLaunchContext` interface in Hadoop YARN defines the information needed to launch a container on a NodeManager. It includes container ID, allocated resources, user details, security tokens, local resources (binaries/jars), service data, environment variables, launch commands, and application ACLs. The interface provides getter and setter methods for each attribute, enabling configuration of container execution parameters. This context is used when starting containers via the `ContainerManager#startContainer` API.
