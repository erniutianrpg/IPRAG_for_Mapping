This code defines a Java interface `Container` for managing YARN containers in Hadoop. It provides methods to access container details like ID, user, state, launch context, security credentials, localized resources, and status. The interface extends `EventHandler` to handle container-related events, enabling state management and operations on containers within the NodeManager. Key functionalities include retrieving container information and managing its lifecycle events.
