This code implements a Protobuf-based RPC client factory for Hadoop YARN. It dynamically loads and caches Protocol Buffer client implementations for given interfaces, constructing clients with specified versions, server addresses, and configurations. The factory uses reflection to find and instantiate PB client classes (following naming conventions like *PBClientImpl) and caches constructors for better performance. It handles errors like missing classes or methods by wrapping them in YarnException.
