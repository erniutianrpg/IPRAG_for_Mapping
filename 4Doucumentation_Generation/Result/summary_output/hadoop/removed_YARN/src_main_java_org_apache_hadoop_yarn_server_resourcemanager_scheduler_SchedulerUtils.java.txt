This code provides utility methods for YARN's resource scheduler in Hadoop. It includes:  
1. Constants for container status messages (released, lost, completed, etc.).  
2. A method (`createAbnormalContainerStatus`) to generate container status records for failed/lost containers.  
3. Methods (`normalizeRequest`, `normalizeRequests`) to adjust resource requests to meet minimum memory requirements by rounding up to multiples of `minMemory`.  

The utilities help manage container lifecycle and resource allocation normalization in the scheduler. (98 words)
