The `RewindableInputStream` class wraps an `InputStream` to make it rewindable by buffering data up to a specified limit (default 1MB). It uses `mark()` and `reset()` to enable rewinding to the stream's start. If more bytes than the buffer size are read, rewinding fails. Main methods include standard `read()` operations and a `rewind()` method to reset the stream position.
