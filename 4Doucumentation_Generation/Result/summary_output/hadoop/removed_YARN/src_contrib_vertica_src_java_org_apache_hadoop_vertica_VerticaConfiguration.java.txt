This code provides configuration management for Hadoop jobs interacting with Vertica databases. It defines constants for Vertica connection properties (hostnames, database, credentials), input/output formats (queries, delimiters), and table operations. The class offers methods to configure these properties, establish JDBC connections to Vertica (selecting random hosts), and manage query parameters. It supports both input (reading) and output (writing) operations with Vertica, including table creation/dropping and streaming data formatting options.
