This code provides utility functions for interacting with Vertica databases in Hadoop MapReduce jobs. Key functionalities include:
1. Checking Vertica database version (`verticaVersion`)
2. Validating output specifications and managing tables (`checkOutputSpecs`), including creating/dropping tables
3. Generating input splits for parallel processing (`getSplits`) by either using parameterized queries or dividing data via limit/offset
4. Handling database connections and configurations through `VerticaConfiguration`

The code enables Hadoop to efficiently read from and write to Vertica databases by managing connections, table structures, and data partitioning.
