The code defines a `JobHistoryParser` interface that extends `Closeable`. Its purpose is to provide a standard way to parse Hadoop job history files. The interface declares a single method `nextEvent()` which returns the next `HistoryEvent` from the parsed file or `null` if no more events exist. It throws an `IOException` for any read errors. This interface serves as a contract for parsing Hadoop job history data.
