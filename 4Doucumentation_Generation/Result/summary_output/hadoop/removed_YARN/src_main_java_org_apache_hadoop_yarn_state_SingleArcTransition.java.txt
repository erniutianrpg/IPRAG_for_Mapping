The code defines a `SingleArcTransition` interface for state transitions in a finite state machine (FSM). It provides a single transition hook method (`transition`) that takes an operand (entity whose state may change) and an event, triggering a state change. This interface is used to implement state transitions where each transition leads to a single predetermined post-state, as registered in the state machine. The interface is generic, supporting any operand and event types.
