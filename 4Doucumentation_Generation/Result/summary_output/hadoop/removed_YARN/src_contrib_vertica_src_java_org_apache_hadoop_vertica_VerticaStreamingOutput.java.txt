This code implements a Hadoop `OutputFormat` for streaming data to a Vertica database. It checks output specifications, creates a record writer that formats data with configurable delimiters and terminators, and generates a COPY statement to stream data directly into Vertica tables. The output committer uses Hadoop's file-based mechanism. Essentially, it enables efficient bulk loading of Hadoop job results into Vertica via streaming.
