The `LinuxResourceCalculatorPlugin` class is a utility for gathering system resource information on Linux by parsing `/proc` files. It provides methods to retrieve:

1. Memory metrics (physical/virtual memory size and available memory)
2. CPU information (number of processors, frequency, cumulative CPU time, and CPU usage percentage)
3. Process-specific resource usage (CPU time and memory)

It reads from `/proc/meminfo`, `/proc/cpuinfo`, and `/proc/stat` to collect this data, caching values where appropriate for efficiency. The class is part of Apache Hadoop's YARN utilities for system resource monitoring.
