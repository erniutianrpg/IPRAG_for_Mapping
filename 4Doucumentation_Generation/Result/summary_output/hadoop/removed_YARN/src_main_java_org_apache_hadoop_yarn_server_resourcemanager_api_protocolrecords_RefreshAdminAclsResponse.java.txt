The code defines an empty Java interface `RefreshAdminAclsResponse` under the `org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.api.protocolrecords` package. It serves as a placeholder response type for refreshing administrator access control lists (ACLs) in Apache Hadoop YARN's Resource Manager API, but contains no methods or functionality itself. The interface is part of the Apache 2.0 licensed Hadoop project.
