This code is a Protocol Buffers (PB) implementation of `StartContainerRequest` in Hadoop YARN. It handles the serialization and deserialization of requests to start containers, converting between Java objects (`ContainerLaunchContext`) and their Protocol Buffers representations. The class maintains a builder pattern for constructing requests and ensures proper conversion between formats while managing proto buffer state via the `viaProto` flag. Key methods include getting/setting the container launch context and merging local changes into the proto format.
