This code implements a Protocol Buffers (PB) service for Hadoop YARN's Client Resource Manager (RM) protocol. It acts as an adapter between PB-based RPC calls and the Java interface `ClientRMProtocol`, converting PB requests to Java objects and vice versa. The service handles various YARN operations like application submission, killing applications, getting application/cluster metrics, queue info, and node information. Each method follows the same pattern: convert PB request to Java, delegate to the real implementation, convert the response back to PB format, and handle exceptions.
