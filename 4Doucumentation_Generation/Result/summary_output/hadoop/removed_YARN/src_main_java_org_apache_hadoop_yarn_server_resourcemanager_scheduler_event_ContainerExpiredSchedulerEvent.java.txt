This code defines a `ContainerExpiredSchedulerEvent` class, which is a scheduler event indicating that a container (identified by `ContainerId`) has expired. The event is triggered by `ContainerAllocationExpirer` and handled by the scheduler. The class extends `SchedulerEvent`, stores the expired container's ID, and provides a getter method to retrieve it. The event type is set to `CONTAINER_EXPIRED`. (98 words)
