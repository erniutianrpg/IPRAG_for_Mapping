This code implements `RMAppImpl`, which represents an application in Apache Hadoop YARN's ResourceManager. Key functionalities include:

1. Manages application lifecycle through a state machine with states like NEW, SUBMITTED, RUNNING, FINISHED, etc.
2. Handles application events (start, kill, reject, attempt failures) and transitions between states.
3. Tracks application attempts, user/queue info, diagnostics, and resource usage.
4. Provides thread-safe access to application state via read-write locks.
5. Generates application reports and maintains timing information (submit/start/finish times).
6. Handles cleanup when applications complete or fail.

The class coordinates with other YARN components (scheduler, dispatcher, application master) to manage the application's execution.
