This code defines an abstract `ResourceCalculatorPlugin` class that provides methods to retrieve system resource information (memory, CPU, processors) for monitoring purposes. It includes methods for total/available physical/virtual memory, CPU metrics, and process-specific resource usage. The class also provides a factory method to instantiate platform-specific implementations (e.g., Linux) or a custom plugin if specified. The plugin is designed for Hadoop YARN to monitor system resources. (98 words)
