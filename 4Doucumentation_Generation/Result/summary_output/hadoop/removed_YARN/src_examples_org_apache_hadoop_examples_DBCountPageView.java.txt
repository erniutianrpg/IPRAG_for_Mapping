This code demonstrates a Hadoop MapReduce job that counts pageviews from a database. It:

1. Sets up an HSQLDB database with Access (url, referrer, time) and Pageview (url, count) tables
2. Populates the Access table with simulated web browsing data
3. Runs a MapReduce job that:
   - Mapper emits <url, 1> for each access record
   - Reducer sums counts per URL
   - Stores results in the Pageview table
4. Verifies the total pageviews match between input and output tables

The program shows how to use DBInputFormat and DBOutputFormat to read from/write to databases in Hadoop. When run with no arguments, it uses a local HSQLDB instance.
