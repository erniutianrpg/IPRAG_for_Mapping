The `SimpleCharStream` class provides a buffered character stream reader that tracks line and column positions for ASCII text processing. It handles reading characters, expanding buffers when needed, and maintaining position information (line/column numbers). The class supports various constructors for different input sources (Reader/InputStream) and includes methods for token extraction, position tracking, and buffer management. It's primarily used for lexical analysis in parsers, though it's marked as deprecated in favor of Avro.
