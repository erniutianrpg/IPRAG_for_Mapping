The `LinuxContainerExecutor` class is a Hadoop YARN NodeManager component that handles container execution on Linux systems. It provides methods to:
1. Initialize and launch containers with proper permissions using a setuid executable
2. Signal running containers (start/stop)
3. Clean up container directories
4. Handle container localization (resource preparation)
5. Manage container lifecycle operations while enforcing security through user permissions

It uses a native container-executor binary to perform privileged operations and handles error conditions with appropriate exit codes and logging.
