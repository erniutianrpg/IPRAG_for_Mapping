This code defines a web page (`NodesPage`) for the Hadoop YARN ResourceManager UI that displays cluster node information. The `NodesBlock` class renders an HTML table showing node details like rack location, state, address, health status, memory usage, and container counts. It filters nodes by state if specified and formats memory values. The page uses jQuery DataTables for interactive table features and updates the title based on any node state filter applied.
