This Java interface `NodeHeartbeatResponse` defines methods for getting and setting a `HeartbeatResponse` object, which is used in YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) for communication between NodeManagers and the ResourceManager. It provides a way to encapsulate the response to a node's heartbeat signal, typically containing instructions or status updates from the ResourceManager. The interface is part of Apache Hadoop's YARN server API. (Words: 63)
