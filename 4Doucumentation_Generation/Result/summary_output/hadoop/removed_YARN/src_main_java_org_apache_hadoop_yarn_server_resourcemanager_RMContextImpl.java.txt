The `RMContextImpl` class implements the `RMContext` interface, serving as a central context for the YARN ResourceManager. It maintains application and node mappings (`ConcurrentMap<ApplicationId, RMApp>` and `ConcurrentMap<NodeId, RMNode>`), provides access to a dispatcher for events, and manages components like `AMLivelinessMonitor`, `ContainerAllocationExpirer`, and `DelegationTokenRenewer`. It also interfaces with the underlying `Store` for recovery purposes. Essentially, it acts as a container for ResourceManager's runtime state and services. (98 words)
