The `AboutBlock` class is a web component that displays cluster information in the YARN ResourceManager web interface. It shows details like cluster ID, ResourceManager state, start time, YARN version, and Hadoop version. The class extends `HtmlBlock` to render this information in HTML format, using data from the ResourceManager instance and version info utilities. The output includes a metrics overview table and an info block with the cluster metadata.
