This code implements the ResourceManager (RM) for Apache Hadoop YARN, which is the central authority for managing resources in a YARN cluster. The RM handles client requests, manages application lifecycles, schedules resources via pluggable schedulers (defaulting to FIFO), tracks node status, and ensures security through token management. Key components include dispatchers for async event handling, services for client/application master communication, node monitoring, and recovery mechanisms. The RM also hosts a web UI and integrates with Hadoop's security and metrics systems. It's designed as a composite service that initializes and coordinates all these subsystems.
