This code implements a Protocol Buffers (PB) message class for the `RegisterApplicationMasterResponse` in Hadoop YARN. It handles conversion between PB formats and Java objects, managing resource capabilities (minimum/maximum) and application ACLs (access control lists). The class provides getters/setters for these fields and maintains internal state synchronization between PB and Java representations. It's part of YARN's API for application masters to register with the ResourceManager.
