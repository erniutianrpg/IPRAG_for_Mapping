This code implements `RMAppAttemptImpl`, which manages the lifecycle of a YARN application attempt in the ResourceManager. Key functionalities include:

1. Maintains state transitions (NEW, SUBMITTED, SCHEDULED, ALLOCATED, LAUNCHED, RUNNING, FINISHED, FAILED, KILLED) via a finite state machine
2. Handles events like container allocation, AM registration, status updates, and failures
3. Tracks attempt details (containers, nodes, diagnostics, progress, tracking URLs)
4. Coordinates with scheduler and AM services for resource allocation
5. Manages AM container lifecycle (launch, monitoring, cleanup)
6. Provides resource usage reporting and attempt metrics

The class serves as the core implementation for managing an application attempt's execution in YARN's ResourceManager.
