The code defines an empty interface `RefreshUserToGroupsMappingsResponse` in the `org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.api.protocolrecords` package, which appears to be a placeholder for a response protocol in Apache Hadoop YARN's Resource Manager API. The interface likely serves as a marker for responses related to refreshing user-to-group mappings, though it contains no methods or fields.
