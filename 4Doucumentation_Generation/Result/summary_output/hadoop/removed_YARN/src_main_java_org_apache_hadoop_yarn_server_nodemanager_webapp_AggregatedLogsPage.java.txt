This code defines a web page (`AggregatedLogsPage`) in Hadoop YARN's Node Manager for displaying aggregated container logs. It sets up the page title with the container ID or entity string, configures UI elements like an accordion menu and theme switcher, and specifies content (`AggregatedLogsBlock`) and navigation (`AggregatedLogsNavBlock`) sections for the page. The page serves as a view for accessing logs of YARN containers. (98 words)
