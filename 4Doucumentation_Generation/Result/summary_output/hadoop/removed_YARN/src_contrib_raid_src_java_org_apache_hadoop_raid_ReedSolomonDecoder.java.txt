The `ReedSolomonDecoder` class implements a Reed-Solomon erasure coding decoder for Hadoop's RAID system. It reconstructs missing or corrupted data blocks using parity blocks by:

1. Identifying erased blocks and their locations
2. Reading data from available blocks and parity blocks
3. Using Reed-Solomon algorithms to reconstruct missing data
4. Writing the recovered data to the output stream

The decoder handles block-level errors, checks for too many failures (beyond parity capacity), and efficiently skips/supplies zero bytes for missing blocks during reconstruction.
