This code defines an interface `RpcClientFactory` for creating RPC (Remote Procedure Call) clients in Apache Hadoop YARN. The interface provides a single method `getClient` that takes a protocol class, client version, server address, and configuration, then returns a client object for communicating with the specified protocol at the given address. It handles client-server communication setup while throwing `YarnException` for errors. The interface supports Hadoop's distributed computing framework.
