This code defines an abstract `Decoder` class for recovering corrupted files in HDFS using parity files. It provides methods to decode a damaged file (`decodeFile`) and recover a corrupt block to a local file (`recoverBlockToFile`). The core functionality involves reading good data blocks and using parity information to reconstruct corrupted blocks. The actual reconstruction logic is left to subclasses via the abstract `fixErasedBlock` method. The decoder handles buffer allocation and configuration for efficient block processing.
