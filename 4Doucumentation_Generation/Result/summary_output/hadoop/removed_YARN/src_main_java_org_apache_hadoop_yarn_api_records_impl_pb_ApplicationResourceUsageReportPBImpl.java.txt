This code implements `ApplicationResourceUsageReport` using Protocol Buffers (PB) for Hadoop YARN. It tracks and manages resource usage metrics for applications, including used, reserved, and needed resources (as `Resource` objects) and container counts. The class provides getters/setters for these metrics and handles conversion between PB and Java formats. It maintains synchronization for thread safety and manages proto buffer construction efficiently.
