This code implements file filtering logic for Hadoop's RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) system. It contains two main filters:

1. `TimeBasedFilter`: Selects files for RAID processing based on modification time, size thresholds, and existing parity files. It skips files that are too new, too small, or already properly RAIDed.

2. `PreferenceFilter`: A two-tier filter that first checks for parity files in a preferred location, falling back to the TimeBasedFilter if none exists.

Both filters help determine which files need RAID processing while avoiding duplicate work on already-protected files. The code includes statistics tracking for monitoring filtered files.
