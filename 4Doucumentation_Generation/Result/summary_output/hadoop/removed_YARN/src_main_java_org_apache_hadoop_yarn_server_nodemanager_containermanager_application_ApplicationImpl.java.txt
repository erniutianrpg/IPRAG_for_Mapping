This code implements a state machine for managing applications in a YARN NodeManager. It handles application lifecycle events (init, run, finish) and container management (adding, removing containers). The state machine transitions between states (NEW, INITING, RUNNING, FINISHING, etc.) based on events, coordinating resource localization, container initialization, and cleanup. It uses thread-safe locks for concurrent access and integrates with auxiliary services like logging and security (ACLs). Key functionalities include initializing applications, launching containers, handling container completion, and cleaning up resources when applications finish.
