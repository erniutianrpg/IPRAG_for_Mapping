The `ClientTokenIdentifier` class represents a token identifier for YARN client authentication. It stores an application ID and implements methods for serialization (`write`/`readFields`), token kind identification (`getKind`), and user information retrieval (`getUser`). The token is marked with `KIND_NAME` as "YARN_CLIENT_TOKEN" and includes a nested `Renewer` class for token renewal. This class is part of Hadoop's security framework for secure client-server communication in YARN.
