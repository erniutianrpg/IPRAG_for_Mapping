The code defines a custom `WebAppException` class that extends `YarnException` in the Hadoop YARN web application framework. It provides three constructors to handle exceptions with: 1) a custom message, 2) a cause (throwable), or 3) both a message and cause. This exception is used to represent errors specific to YARN web applications, inheriting basic exception functionality from its parent class. The class includes a serial version UID for serialization compatibility. (98 words)
