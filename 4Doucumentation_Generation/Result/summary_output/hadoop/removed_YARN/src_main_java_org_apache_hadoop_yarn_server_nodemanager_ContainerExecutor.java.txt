This code defines an abstract `ContainerExecutor` class that provides core functionality for managing containers in a YARN NodeManager. Key features include: launching containers with proper permissions and environment setup, signaling containers (start/stop/kill), managing container lifecycle (activate/deactivate), and handling process IDs. It uses thread-safe data structures for tracking active containers and provides utility methods for process management. The class serves as a base for platform-specific container executors, handling common operations while allowing subclasses to implement OS-specific details.
