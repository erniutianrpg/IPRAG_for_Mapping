This code defines `AppSchedulingInfo`, a class in Hadoop YARN that tracks resource consumption and container allocations for an application. It maintains resource requests by priority, handles updates from the ApplicationMaster, and manages container allocations (node-local, rack-local, or off-switch). The class also interacts with queue metrics to track pending/running applications and resource usage. Key functionalities include updating resource requests, allocating containers, clearing requests when stopping, and managing queue assignments.
