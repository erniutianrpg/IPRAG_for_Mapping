The `ResourceLocalizedEvent` class represents an event indicating that a resource has been successfully localized (downloaded and cached) on a node. It extends `ResourceEvent` and stores the resource's location (as a `Path`) and size (as a `long`). The class provides getter methods to access these properties. This event is used in Hadoop YARN's NodeManager to track resource localization status. (97 words)
