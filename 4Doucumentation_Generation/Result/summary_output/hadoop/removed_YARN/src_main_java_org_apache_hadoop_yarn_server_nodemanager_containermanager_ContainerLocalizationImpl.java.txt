The `ContainerLocalizationImpl` class is a stub implementation for localizing containers in YARN's NodeManager. It receives a dispatcher for events, an application context, and a localization protocol, but currently contains no functionality (empty constructor). This class appears to be part of the container management system for handling resource localization (preparing container files).
