The `LocalizerSecurityInfo` class extends Hadoop's `SecurityInfo` to provide security information for the YARN NodeManager's localizer service. It overrides `getTokenInfo()` to return a `TokenInfo` implementation that specifies the `LocalizerTokenSelector` for token selection when the protocol is `LocalizationProtocolService`. This enables secure communication between the NodeManager and containers using authentication tokens. The `getKerberosInfo()` method returns null as Kerberos isn't configured here.
