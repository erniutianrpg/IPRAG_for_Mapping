The provided code implements `DistCp`, a distributed copy tool for Hadoop that recursively copies directories between different filesystems. Key functionalities include:

1. **Recursive Copy**: Copies files/directories from source to destination across filesystems.
2. **Preservation Options**: Maintains file attributes (permissions, replication, timestamps) via `-p` flag.
3. **Update/Sync**: Only copies files that are new/changed (`-update`).
4. **Overwrite**: Forces overwrite of existing files (`-overwrite`).
5. **Parallelism**: Uses MapReduce for distributed copying with configurable map tasks.
6. **Validation**: Verifies copies via checksums (unless skipped with `-skipcrccheck`).
7. **Deletion**: Removes files at destination not present in source (`-delete`).
8. **Dry Run**: Simulates copy operation without actual transfer (`-dryrun`).

The tool handles large-scale data transfers efficiently with fault tolerance and progress reporting.
