This code implements a Protocol Buffers (PB) based wrapper for YARN's Priority record. It provides methods to get/set priority values and compare priorities. The class extends ProtoBase and handles conversion between PB protocol messages (PriorityProto) and Java objects, maintaining state via a builder pattern. Key functionality includes priority management (get/set) and comparison between Priority objects.
