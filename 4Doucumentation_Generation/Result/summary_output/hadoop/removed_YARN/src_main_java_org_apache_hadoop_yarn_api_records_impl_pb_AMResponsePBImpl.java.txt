This code implements a Protocol Buffers (PB) version of the `AMResponse` interface in Hadoop YARN, which handles communication between the ApplicationMaster and ResourceManager. It manages:
1. Response metadata (reboot flag, response ID)
2. Resource availability information
3. Lists of allocated containers and their completion statuses
4. Conversion between PB and Java object formats
5. Synchronized access to all fields for thread safety

The class acts as an adapter between protocol buffer messages and Java objects, maintaining both representations and keeping them synchronized.
