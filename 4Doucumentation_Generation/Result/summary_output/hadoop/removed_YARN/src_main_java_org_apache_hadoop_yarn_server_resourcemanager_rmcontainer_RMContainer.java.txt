The code defines an `RMContainer` interface in Hadoop YARN that represents a container managed by the ResourceManager. It provides methods to access container details like ID, state, associated application attempt, reserved resources, node, and priority. The interface also extends `EventHandler` to handle container-related events, enabling state management and lifecycle operations. This serves as a key component for resource allocation and tracking in YARN. (98 words)
