This code implements a Protocol Buffers (PB) based class `GetClusterNodesResponsePBImpl` that handles cluster node information responses in Hadoop YARN. It converts between PB formats and Java objects, maintaining a list of `NodeReport` objects representing cluster nodes. The class provides methods to get/set node reports and manages PB proto conversions, ensuring thread-safe operations while maintaining data consistency between proto and local formats.
