The `YarnVersionInfo` class retrieves and provides version-related metadata for Apache YARN, including version number, revision, branch, build date, user, source URL, and checksum. It uses annotations to extract this information from the package and offers methods to access individual components or a consolidated build version string. The main method prints this version information for command-line viewing.
