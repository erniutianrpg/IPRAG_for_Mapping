This code implements a two-column webpage layout for Apache Hadoop YARN's web interface. It extends `HtmlPage` to create a structure with a header, left navigation bar, content area, and footer. The layout uses HTML tables with CSS styling for positioning and includes methods to customize header, content, navigation, and footer sections. The class provides hooks (`preHead` and `postHead`) for additional styling or scripting and includes helper methods for table styling. It's designed to work with resizable themes and integrates with JQueryUI.
