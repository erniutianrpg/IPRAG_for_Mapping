This code implements a web interface for YARN's ResourceManager, specifically for the FIFO scheduler. It displays queue information including status, memory capacities, and node statistics. The `QueueInfoBlock` class renders queue details, while `QueuesBlock` creates a visual representation of queue utilization. The page uses jQuery for interactive elements like expandable trees and provides filtering capabilities. The UI shows resource allocation metrics, node capacities, and queue states (Running/Stopped) in a tabular format with percentage-based visualizations.
