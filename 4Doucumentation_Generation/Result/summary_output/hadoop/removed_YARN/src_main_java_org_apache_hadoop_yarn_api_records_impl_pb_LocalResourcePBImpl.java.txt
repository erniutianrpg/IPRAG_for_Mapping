This code is a Protocol Buffers (PB) implementation of the `LocalResource` interface in Apache Hadoop YARN. It provides methods to get/set resource properties (size, timestamp, type, URL, visibility) and handles conversion between PB and Java formats. The class manages a PB builder and proto instance, ensuring proper synchronization between them. It's essentially a wrapper that enables serialization/deserialization of local resource metadata for YARN applications.
