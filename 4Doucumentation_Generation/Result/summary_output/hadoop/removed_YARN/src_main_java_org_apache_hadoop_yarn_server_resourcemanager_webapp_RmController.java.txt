This code implements a controller for the ResourceManager web interface in Apache Hadoop YARN. It handles various HTTP requests to display information about: 
1) Applications (status, logs, tracking URLs)
2) Cluster nodes
3) Scheduler configuration (Capacity/Default)
4) Queue details
5) Application submission
6) JSON data

The controller performs authorization checks, sets response status/titles, and renders appropriate views for each request type. Key features include application tracking, access control, and cluster resource management visualization.
