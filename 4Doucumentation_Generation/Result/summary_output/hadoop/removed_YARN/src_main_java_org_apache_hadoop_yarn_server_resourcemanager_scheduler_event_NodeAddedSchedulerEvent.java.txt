This code defines a `NodeAddedSchedulerEvent` class, which is a scheduler event in Hadoop YARN indicating that a new node (`RMNode`) has been added to the cluster. The event carries the node information and extends a base `SchedulerEvent` with type `NODE_ADDED`. It provides a getter method `getAddedRMNode()` to access the added node. (60 words)
