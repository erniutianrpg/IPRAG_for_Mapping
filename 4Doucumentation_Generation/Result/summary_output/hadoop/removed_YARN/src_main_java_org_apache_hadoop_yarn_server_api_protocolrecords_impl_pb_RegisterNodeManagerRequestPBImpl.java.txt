This code implements a Protocol Buffers (PB) message class `RegisterNodeManagerRequestPBImpl` for Hadoop YARN, handling registration requests from Node Managers to the Resource Manager. It manages node ID, resource capabilities, and HTTP port information, converting between PB formats and Java objects. The class provides getter/setter methods for these attributes while handling protocol buffer serialization/deserialization internally.
