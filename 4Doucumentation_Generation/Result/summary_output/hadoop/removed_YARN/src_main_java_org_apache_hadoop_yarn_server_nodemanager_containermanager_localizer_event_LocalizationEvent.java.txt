The code defines a `LocalizationEvent` class that extends `AbstractEvent` for the `ResourceLocalizationService` in Hadoop YARN.

The class constructor takes a `LocalizationEventType` parameter to specify the event type. This serves as a base event class for localization-related operations. (98 words)
