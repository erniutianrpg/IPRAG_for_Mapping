This code defines an enum `DFSActions` representing various actions for a DFS (Distributed File System) browser. Each action (e.g., DELETE, REFRESH, DOWNLOAD) has a display title and a unique ID prefixed with `"dfs.browser.action."`. The enum provides a method `getById()` to retrieve an action by its ID. The actions include file operations like upload/download, directory management, and connection controls for interacting with a DFS.
