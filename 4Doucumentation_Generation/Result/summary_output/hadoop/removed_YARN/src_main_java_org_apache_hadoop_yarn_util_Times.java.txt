The `Times` utility class provides methods for time calculations and formatting in a thread-safe manner. It offers: 
1. `elapsed()` to compute duration between start/end times, handling running/stopped states.
2. `format()` to convert timestamps to "d-MMM-yyyy HH:mm:ss" format using a thread-local `SimpleDateFormat`.
3. Returns "N/A" for invalid timestamps and -1 for stopped processes. The class ensures thread safety by using `ThreadLocal` for date formatting.
