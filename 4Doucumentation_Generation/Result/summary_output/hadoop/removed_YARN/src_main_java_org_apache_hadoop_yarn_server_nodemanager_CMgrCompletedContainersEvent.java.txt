This code defines a `CMgrCompletedContainersEvent` class in Hadoop YARN's NodeManager, which represents an event for cleaning up completed containers. It extends `ContainerManagerEvent` and stores a list of `ContainerId` objects to be cleaned up. The event type is `FINISH_CONTAINERS`, and it provides a getter method to retrieve the list of containers marked for cleanup. This facilitates container lifecycle management in YARN. (98 words)
