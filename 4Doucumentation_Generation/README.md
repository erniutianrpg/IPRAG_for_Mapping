# ðŸ“„ Documentation Generation

The objective of this project is to generate missing documentation for project modules and to evaluate the consistency and relevance between the generated documentationâ€”produced in the absence of a given moduleâ€”and the actual documentation of that module. Additionally, the coherence and fluency of the generated documentation itself will be assessed.
