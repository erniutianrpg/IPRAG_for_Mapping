ModuleDescriptions : {
    "This module represents the core data structures such as BibDatases, BibEntries, Events, and related aspects. It has only a small amount of attached logic and should have no dependencies on other JabRef classes."
    "This module is responsible for reading, writing, importing, exporting, and manipulating the model. It is often structured as an API that the outer GUI layer can call and use, and should only depend on classes from the Model."
    "This package bundles together the classes that are responsible for JabRefâ€™s command line interface."
    "Represents all customizable information by a user to fit personal needs."
