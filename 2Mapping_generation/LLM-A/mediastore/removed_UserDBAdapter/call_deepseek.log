    Reason step by step based on these comparisons. If the file does not clearly belong to any module, respond with '**Assigned Module**: ['None']'.

    File content:
    {"package": "edu.kit.ipd.sdq.mediastore.basic.data", "classes": [{"class_name": "CurrentUser", "class_type": "class", "annotations": [], "inheritance": {"parent_class": null, "implemented_interfaces": ["Serializable"]}, "fields": ["Long id", "String firstname", "String lastname", "String email", "String passwordHash"], "methods": ["getId()", "setId(Long)", "getFirstname()", "setFirstname(String)", "getLastname()", "setLastname(String)", "getEmail()", "setEmail(String)", "getPasswordHash()", "setPasswordHash(String)", "toString()"]}]}    

    Candidate Modules:
    Facade: This is a server-side web front end component of Media Store that delivers websites to the users, provides session management, and enables users to browse, download, and upload audio files.
MediaManagement: This is a central business logic component that coordinates the communication of other components. It fetches audio files from a specific location when processing download requests and forwards these files from the TagWatermarking component to the user.
UserManagement: This component handles the user authentication process. It answers registration and login requests and implements functions to hash and salt the passwords.
TagWatermarking: This component digitally and individually watermarks each downloaded audio file to reduce the risk of copyright infringements.
Packaging: This module is responsible for archiving multiple audio files into a single compressed file enabling users to download multiple files at once.
ReEncoder: The ReEncoder module converts the bit rates of audio files, which can lead to a reduction of file sizes.
Database: This component represents an actual database (e.g., MySQL). It stores user information, meta-data of audio files, and salted hashes of passwords.
MediaAccess: This module handles storage of uploaded audio file at predefined locations. It encapsulates database access for meta-data of audio files and fetches a list of all available audio files.
FileStorage: This module stores all audio files in a specific location (e.g., a dedicated file server or a local disk) to decouple itself from the database. Uploaded files are stored without any change, while a download can trigger re-encoding of the audio file.

    You are an expert at mapping code files to architecture modules. Analyze the given file's content and package, and compare it with the listed candidate modules. Use the listed reference examples below to guide your reasoning and help determine the most appropriate module.
    Reason step by step based on these comparisons. If the file does not clearly belong to any module, respond with '**Assigned Module**: ['None']'.

    File content:
    {"package": "edu.kit.ipd.sdq.mediastore.ejb.userdbadapter", "classes": [{"class_name": "User", "class_type": "class", "annotations": ["Entity", "NamedQueries", "TableGenerator"], "inheritance": {"parent_class": null, "implemented_interfaces": ["Serializable"]}, "fields": ["Long id", "String firstname", "String lastname", "String email", "String password"], "methods": ["getFirstname()", "setFirstname(String)", "getLastname()", "setLastname(String)", "getEmail()", "setEmail(String)", "getPassword()", "setPassword(String)", "getId()", "setId(Long)", "toString()"]}]}    

    Candidate Modules:
    Facade: This is a server-side web front end component of Media Store that delivers websites to the users, provides session management, and enables users to browse, download, and upload audio files.
MediaManagement: This is a central business logic component that coordinates the communication of other components. It fetches audio files from a specific location when processing download requests and forwards these files from the TagWatermarking component to the user.
UserManagement: This component handles the user authentication process. It answers registration and login requests and implements functions to hash and salt the passwords.
TagWatermarking: This component digitally and individually watermarks each downloaded audio file to reduce the risk of copyright infringements.
Packaging: This module is responsible for archiving multiple audio files into a single compressed file enabling users to download multiple files at once.
ReEncoder: The ReEncoder module converts the bit rates of audio files, which can lead to a reduction of file sizes.
Database: This component represents an actual database (e.g., MySQL). It stores user information, meta-data of audio files, and salted hashes of passwords.
MediaAccess: This module handles storage of uploaded audio file at predefined locations. It encapsulates database access for meta-data of audio files and fetches a list of all available audio files.
FileStorage: This module stores all audio files in a specific location (e.g., a dedicated file server or a local disk) to decouple itself from the database. Uploaded files are stored without any change, while a download can trigger re-encoding of the audio file.
