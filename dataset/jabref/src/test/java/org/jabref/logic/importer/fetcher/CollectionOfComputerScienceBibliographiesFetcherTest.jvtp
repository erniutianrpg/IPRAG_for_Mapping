                 withfield standardfield the open source application jabref has existed since    
                          2003  in 2015  the developers decided to make an    
                          architectural refactoring as continued development was    
                          deemed too demanding  the developers also introduced architecture conformance checking  sacc  to    
                          prevent violations to the intended architecture     
                          measurements mined from source code repositories such    
                          as code churn and code ownership has been linked to    
                          several problems example fault proneness  security    
                          vulnerabilities  code smells  and degraded    
                          maintainability  the root cause of such problems can be    
                          architectural  to determine the impact of the    
                          refactoring of jabref  we measure the code churn and    
                          code ownership before and after the refactoring and    
                          find that large files with violations had a    
                          significantly higher code churn than large files    
                          without violations before the refactoring  after the    
                          refactoring  the files that had violations show a more    
                          normal code churn  we find no such effect on code    
                          ownership  we conclude that files that contain    
                          violations detectable by sacc methods are connected to    
                          higher than normal code churn
