                 withfield standardfield we establish a general slice theorem the action of a locally convex         lie group on a locally convex manifold  which generalizes the         classical slice theorem of palais to infinite dimensions  we         discuss two important settings under which the assumptions of theorem are fulfilled  first  using gl \\\ o ckner's inverse         function theorem  we show that the linear action of a compact         lie group on a fr \\'e chet space admits a slice  second  using         the nash--moser theorem  we establish a slice theorem the         tame action of a tame fr \\'e chet lie group on a tame         fr \\'e chet manifold purpose  we develop the concept         of a graded riemannian metric  which allows the construction of         a path-length metric compatible with the manifold topology and         of a local addition generalizing a classical result in         finite dimensions  we prove that the existence of a slice         implies that the decomposition of the manifold into orbit types         of the group action is a stratification
