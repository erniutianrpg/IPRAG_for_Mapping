             withfield standardfield several open-source software  oss  projects depend on the continuity of their development communities to remain sustainable  understanding how developers become inactive or why they take breaks can help communities prevent abandonment and incentivize developers to come back  in paper  we propose a novel method to identify developersâ inactive periods by analyzing the individual rhythm of contributions to the projects  using method  we quantitatively analyze the inactivity of core developers in 18 oss organizations hosted on github  we also survey core developers to receive their feedback about the identified breaks and transitions  our results show that our method was effective identifying developersâ breaks  about 94% of the surveyed core developers agreed with our state model of inactivity  71% and 79% of them acknowledged their breaks and state transition  respectively  we also show that all core developers take breaks  at least once  and about a half of them  ~45%  have completely disengaged from a project at least one year  we also analyzed the probability of transitions to from inactivity and found that developers who pause their activity have aâ~35 to ~55% chance to to an active state  yet the lasts a year or longer  then the probability of resuming activities drops to ~21â26%  with aâ~54% chance of complete disengagement  these results may support the creation of policies and mechanisms to make oss community managers aware of breaks and potential project abandonment
