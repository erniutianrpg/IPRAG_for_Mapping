                 withfield standardfield a general slice theorem the action of a fr\\'echet lie group on a fr\\'echet manifolds is established  the nash-moser theorem provides the fundamental tool to generalize the result of palais to infinite-dimensional setting  the presented slice theorem is illustrated by its application to gauge theories  the action of the gauge transformation group admits smooth slices at every point and thus the gauge orbit space is stratified by fr\\'echet manifolds  furthermore  a covariant and symplectic formulation of classical field theory is proposed and extensively discussed  at the root of novel framework is the incorporation of field degrees of freedom f and spacetime m into the product manifold f   m  the induced bigrading of differential forms is used in order to carry over the usual symplectic theory to setting  the examples of the klein-gordon field and general yang-mills theory illustrate that the presented approach conveniently handles the occurring symmetries

                 withfield standardfield context  data mining  dm  method has been evolving year by year and as of today there is also the enhancement of dm technique that can be run several times faster than the traditional one  called distributed data mining  ddm   it is not a field in data processing actually  but in the recent years many researchers have been paying more attention on area  problems  the number of publication regarding ddm in high reputation journals and conferences has increased significantly  it makes difficult researchers to gain a comprehensive view of ddm that require further research  solution  we conducted a systematic literature review to map the previous research in ddm field  our objective is to provide the motivation research by identifying the gap in ddm field as well as the hot area itself  result  our analysis came up with some conclusions by answering 7 research questions proposed in literature review  in addition  the taxonomy of ddm research area is presented in paper systematic literature review provides the statistic of development of ddm since 2000 to 2015  in which will help the future researchers to have a comprehensive overview of current situation of ddm
