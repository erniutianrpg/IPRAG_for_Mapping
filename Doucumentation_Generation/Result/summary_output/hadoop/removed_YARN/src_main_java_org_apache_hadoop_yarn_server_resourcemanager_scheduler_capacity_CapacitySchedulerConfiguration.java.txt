The `CapacitySchedulerConfiguration` class manages configuration settings for Hadoop YARN's Capacity Scheduler. It handles queue properties like capacity, maximum capacity, user limits, ACLs, and queue states. The class reads from `capacity-scheduler.xml`, provides default values for settings, and includes validation for queue capacities. It also manages resource allocations (minimum/maximum memory) and system-wide settings like maximum applications and application master resource percentage. The class serves as a configuration wrapper with getter/setter methods for scheduler properties.
