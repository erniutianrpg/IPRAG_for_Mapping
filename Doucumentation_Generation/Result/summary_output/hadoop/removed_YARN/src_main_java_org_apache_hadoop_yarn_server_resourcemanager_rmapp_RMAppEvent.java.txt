This code defines an `RMAppEvent` class, which represents an event in the Hadoop YARN ResourceManager related to application management. It extends `AbstractEvent` with `RMAppEventType` and contains an `ApplicationId` to identify the application. The class provides a constructor to create events with specific types and application IDs, and a getter method to retrieve the application ID. Essentially, it's a basic event class for tracking application state changes in YARN's ResourceManager. (98 words)
