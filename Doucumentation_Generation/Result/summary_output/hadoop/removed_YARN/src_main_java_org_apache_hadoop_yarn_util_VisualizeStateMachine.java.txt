This code visualizes state machines defined in classes. It takes class names as input, extracts their `StateMachineFactory` static fields via reflection, and generates a state transition graph. For multiple classes, it combines their graphs into one. The main method accepts a graph name, comma-separated class names, and an output file path, then saves the visualization. The tool helps understand state machine behavior in YARN applications. (98 words)
