This code implements a Protocol Buffers (PB) wrapper class `ApplicationMasterPBImpl` for Hadoop YARN's `ApplicationMaster` record. It provides getter/setter methods for application master attributes like state, host, application ID, RPC port, tracking URL, status, client token, failure count, container count, and diagnostics. The class handles conversion between PB and Java formats while maintaining synchronization between local fields and the underlying PB representation. It's part of YARN's API for managing application master information in a distributed environment.
