This code defines a `LogHandlerAppFinishedEvent` class in Hadoop YARN, which represents an event triggered when an application finishes execution. It extends `LogHandlerEvent` and contains the `ApplicationId` of the finished application. The class provides a constructor to create the event and a getter method to retrieve the application ID. This event is used by the NodeManager's log handler to manage application logs after completion. (98 words)
