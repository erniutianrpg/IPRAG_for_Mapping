This code monitors a Hadoop NameNode for corrupt data blocks. When corrupt blocks are found, it launches a MapReduce job to analyze them, prints the results, and cleans up temporary files. It runs continuously, checking for new corrupt blocks at specified intervals. The tool requires four arguments: NameNode URL, sleep time between checks, MapReduce jar location, and HDFS input path. It uses XML parsing to detect corrupt blocks and Hadoop commands to execute the forensic analysis.
