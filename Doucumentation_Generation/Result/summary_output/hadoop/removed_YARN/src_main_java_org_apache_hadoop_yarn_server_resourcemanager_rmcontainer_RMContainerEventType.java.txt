This code defines an enum `RMContainerEventType` that represents different types of events for a YARN ResourceManager container. The events include lifecycle actions like `START`, `KILL`, `LAUNCHED`, `FINISHED`, and `RELEASED`, as well as state changes like `ACQUIRED`, `RESERVED`, and `EXPIRE`. These events originate from various components like the scheduler, node, or application master, and are used to manage container states in the ResourceManager. (98 words)
