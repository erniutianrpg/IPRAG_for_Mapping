This code implements a NodeStatusUpdater service in Hadoop YARN's NodeManager. Its main functionality is to:

1. Register the NodeManager with the ResourceManager during startup
2. Periodically send heartbeats containing node status (health, running containers) to the ResourceManager
3. Handle responses from ResourceManager including shutdown commands and cleanup requests
4. Maintain security by managing shared secrets for container authentication
5. Track and report resource utilization metrics

The service runs in a dedicated thread and manages communication between the NodeManager and ResourceManager, ensuring the cluster stays synchronized with the node's status.
