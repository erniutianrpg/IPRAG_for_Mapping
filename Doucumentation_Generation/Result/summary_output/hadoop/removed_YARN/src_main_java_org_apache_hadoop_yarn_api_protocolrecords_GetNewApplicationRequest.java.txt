This code defines an interface `GetNewApplicationRequest` in the Hadoop YARN framework. It serves as a request sent by clients to obtain a new `ApplicationId` for submitting an application to the YARN ResourceManager. The interface is marked as `@Public` and `@Stable`, indicating it's part of the public API and stable for use. It works with `ClientRMProtocol.getNewApplication()` to generate unique application IDs.
