The `ClientRMService` class implements the `ClientRMProtocol` interface to handle client RPC requests in Hadoop YARN's ResourceManager. It provides functionality for:

1. Application management (submit, kill, get reports)
2. Cluster metrics and node information retrieval
3. Queue information and access control
4. New application ID generation

The service validates user access via `ApplicationACLsManager`, processes requests through the scheduler and RM context, and logs audit events. It runs as an RPC server to handle client interactions with the ResourceManager.
