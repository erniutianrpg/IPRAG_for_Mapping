This code defines a `ContainerResourceLocalizedEvent` class in Hadoop YARN, which represents an event when a container's resource is successfully localized (downloaded and prepared) on a node. It extends `ContainerResourceEvent` and adds a `Path` field to store the localized resource's location. The class provides a constructor to create the event with container ID, resource request, and location path, plus a getter method to retrieve the location. This event is used in the NodeManager's container management workflow. (98 words)
