This code defines a `Context` interface for Hadoop YARN's NodeManager, which serves as a shared information hub across NodeManager components. It provides methods to access: the node's ID (`NodeId`), a map of running applications (`ApplicationId` to `Application`), a map of active containers (`ContainerId` to `Container`), and the node's health status (`NodeHealthStatus`). The interface enables components to retrieve and manage node-level and container-related data in a thread-safe manner using concurrent maps.
