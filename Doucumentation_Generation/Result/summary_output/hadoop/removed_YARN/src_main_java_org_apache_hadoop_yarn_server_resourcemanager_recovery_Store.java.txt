This code defines a `Store` interface for persisting and recovering YARN ResourceManager state. It extends `NodeStore` and `ApplicationsStore`, providing methods to store/restore node manager information, application details (including submission context, containers, and application master), and the last logged node ID. The interface includes nested interfaces `ApplicationInfo` (for app-specific data) and `RMState` (for the overall recovered state), with methods to restore state (`restore()`) and mark recovery completion (`doneWithRecovery()`). It's part of YARN's recovery mechanism for fault tolerance.
