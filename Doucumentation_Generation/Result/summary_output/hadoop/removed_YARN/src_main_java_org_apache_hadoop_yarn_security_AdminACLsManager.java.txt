The `AdminACLsManager` class manages administrator access control lists (ACLs) in a YARN cluster. It initializes with the current user as an admin, reads ACL configurations, and provides methods to check if a user has admin privileges. Key functionalities include verifying admin access (`isAdmin`, `checkAccess`), checking if ACLs are enabled (`areACLsEnabled`), and retrieving the admin ACL list (`getAdminAcl`). Access checks respect the cluster's ACL enablement setting.
