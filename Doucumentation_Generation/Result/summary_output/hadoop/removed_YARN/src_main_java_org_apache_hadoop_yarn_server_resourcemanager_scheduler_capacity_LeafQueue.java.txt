This code implements a `LeafQueue` class for the Hadoop YARN Capacity Scheduler, which manages resources for applications in a single queue. Key functionalities include:

1. Queue configuration (capacity, limits, ACLs)
2. Application lifecycle management (submission, activation, completion)
3. Resource allocation and tracking (memory, containers)
4. User-level resource limits and fairness enforcement
5. Container assignment with locality preferences (node-local, rack-local, off-switch)
6. Metrics collection and reporting

The queue enforces capacity limits, user limits, and application limits while managing resources hierarchically with its parent queue. It handles container reservations, allocations, and releases while maintaining utilization metrics.
