This code defines an abstract base class `View` for web application views in Apache Hadoop YARN. It provides common functionality for handling HTTP requests/responses, managing view contexts, rendering sub-views, and accessing request parameters. Key features include request/response handling, cookie management, URL generation, parameter lookup, and view nesting capabilities. The class serves as a foundation for building web views with dependency injection support through Guice, and includes utilities for error handling, development mode detection, and response writing.
