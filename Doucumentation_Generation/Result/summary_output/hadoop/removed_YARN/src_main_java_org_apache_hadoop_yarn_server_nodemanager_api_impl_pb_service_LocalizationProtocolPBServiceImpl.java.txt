This code implements a Protocol Buffer (PB) service for YARN Node Manager's localization protocol. It acts as an adapter between PB-based RPC calls and Java interface calls. The main functionality is handling heartbeat messages from localizers (components that localize resources), converting PB requests to Java objects, invoking the real service implementation, and converting responses back to PB format. Any exceptions are wrapped as ServiceException. Essentially, it enables PB-based communication for localizer status updates in Hadoop YARN.
