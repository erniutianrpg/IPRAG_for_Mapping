This code implements an RPC server factory for Hadoop YARN using Protocol Buffers (PB). It creates RPC servers by dynamically loading and instantiating PB service implementations through reflection. The factory caches constructors and methods for efficiency, generates appropriate class names for PB services, and uses Hadoop's RPC engine to create servers that handle incoming requests. The server supports configuration, security tokens, and multiple handlers.
