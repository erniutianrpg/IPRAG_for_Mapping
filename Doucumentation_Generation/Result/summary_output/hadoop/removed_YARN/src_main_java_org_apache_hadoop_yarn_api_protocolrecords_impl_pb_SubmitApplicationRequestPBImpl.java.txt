This code implements a Protocol Buffers (PB) version of `SubmitApplicationRequest` in Hadoop YARN. It handles the conversion between Java objects and their PB representations for submitting YARN applications. The class maintains an `ApplicationSubmissionContext` and provides methods to get/set this context while managing PB serialization/deserialization internally. Key functionality includes proto message building, merging local changes, and converting between PB and Java formats.
