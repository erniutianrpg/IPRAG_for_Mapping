This code defines an `ArithmeticProgression` class representing a mathematical sequence with a start value (`value`), common difference (`delta`), and end limit (`limit`). Key functionalities include:

- Constructing and validating arithmetic progressions (throws if `delta=0`)
- Comparing sequences based on their limits
- Checking if one progression contains another
- Calculating steps and skipping values in the sequence
- Converting to/from string representation
- Equality comparison (with symbol matching requirement)

The class is used for mathematical computations in the Apache Hadoop project.
