This code defines the `GetQueueInfoResponse` interface in Hadoop YARN, which represents a response from the ResourceManager to a client requesting information about a specific queue. The response contains a `QueueInfo` object that provides details like queue name, capacities, running applications, and child queues. The interface includes methods to get and (privately) set the `QueueInfo` object. It's marked as public and stable for client use.
