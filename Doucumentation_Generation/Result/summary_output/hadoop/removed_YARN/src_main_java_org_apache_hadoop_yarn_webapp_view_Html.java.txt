This code defines a utility class `Html` for HTML-related operations. It contains a method `isValidId` that checks if a given string is a valid HTML ID using a regular expression pattern (`^[a-zA-Z_.0-9]+$`). Valid IDs must consist of alphanumeric characters, underscores, periods, and no spaces or special characters. The class is part of the Apache Hadoop YARN web application framework.
