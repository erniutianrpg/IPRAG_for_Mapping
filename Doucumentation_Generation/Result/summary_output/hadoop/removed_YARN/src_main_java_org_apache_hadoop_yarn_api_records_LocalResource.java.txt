The `LocalResource` interface defines a local resource needed to run a container in Hadoop YARN. It includes methods to get/set the resource's location (URL), size, timestamp (for verification), type (e.g., file or archive), and visibility (public, private, or application-specific). The NodeManager uses this to localize resources before container launch.
