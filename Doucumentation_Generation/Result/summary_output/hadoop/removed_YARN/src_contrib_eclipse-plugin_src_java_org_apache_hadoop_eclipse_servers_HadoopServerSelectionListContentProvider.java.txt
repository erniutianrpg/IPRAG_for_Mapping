This code provides a content and label provider for displaying Hadoop server selections in an Eclipse UI table. It implements `IStructuredContentProvider` to fetch server instances from `ServerRegistry` and `ITableLabelProvider` to display server names (column 0) and master hostnames (column 1). The class serves as a bridge between Hadoop server data and Eclipse's table viewer components.
