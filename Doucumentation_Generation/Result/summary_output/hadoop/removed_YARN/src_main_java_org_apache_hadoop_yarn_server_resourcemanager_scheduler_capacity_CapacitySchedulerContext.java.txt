The `CapacitySchedulerContext` interface provides read-only access to key configuration and runtime information for the Capacity Scheduler in Hadoop YARN. It exposes methods to retrieve scheduler configuration, minimum/maximum resource capabilities, container token security manager, cluster node count, RM context, and total cluster resources. This serves as a controlled access point for scheduler-related data without allowing modifications.
