This code implements a Protocol Buffers (PB) message class `FinishApplicationMasterRequestPBImpl` that represents a request to finish an ApplicationMaster in Hadoop YARN. It handles conversion between Java objects and protocol buffer format for fields like ApplicationAttemptId, diagnostics message, tracking URL, and final application status. The class provides getters/setters for these fields while managing proto buffer serialization/deserialization internally. It extends `ProtoBase` to inherit basic proto buffer functionality.
