This code defines an abstract class `TaskAttemptInfo` that represents statistics about a Hadoop task attempt from job history. It stores the task's final state (SUCCEEDED or FAILED), associated `TaskInfo`, and split vectors. The class provides methods to get the task's runtime, state, and split vectors. It enforces valid states through constructor validation and serves as a base for concrete task attempt information implementations.
