The `RMAuditLogger` class provides functionality for logging audit events in Apache Hadoop YARN's ResourceManager. It formats logs as tab-separated key-value pairs for both successful and failed operations, including details like user, operation type, target, result, IP address, permissions, and application/container IDs. The class offers multiple overloaded methods to log different types of events (e.g., application submission, container allocation) with varying levels of detail. Success logs are written at INFO level, while failures are logged as WARN.
