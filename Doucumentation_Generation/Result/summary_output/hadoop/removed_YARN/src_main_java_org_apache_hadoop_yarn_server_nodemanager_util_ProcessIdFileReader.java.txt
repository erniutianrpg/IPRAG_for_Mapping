This code reads a process ID (PID) from a specified file path. It checks each line of the file for a valid positive number and returns the first one found as a string. If the file doesn't exist or contains no valid PID, it returns null. The code handles file operations safely with proper resource cleanup and includes logging for debugging. It throws an IOException if the path is null.
