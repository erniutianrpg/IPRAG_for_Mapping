This code implements an Ant task (`DfsTask`) that wraps Hadoop's `FsShell` (File System Shell) to execute HDFS commands within Ant builds. It allows configuring commands, arguments, output/error properties, and failure handling. The task manages I/O redirection, classloading, and error propagation. Key features include command execution via `ToolRunner`, configurable output capturing, and optional failure on errors. It's essentially a bridge between Ant and Hadoop's filesystem operations.
