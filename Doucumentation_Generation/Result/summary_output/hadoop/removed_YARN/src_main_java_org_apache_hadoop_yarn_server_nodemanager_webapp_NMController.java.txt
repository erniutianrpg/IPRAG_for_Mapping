The `NMController` class is a web controller for the NodeManager in Hadoop YARN, handling various web UI endpoints. It manages requests for node information, applications, containers, and logs. Key functionalities include rendering pages for node status, all applications/containers, specific application/container details, and log aggregation redirection when enabled. The logs method checks for log aggregation settings and redirects to a log server if configured. The class extends `Controller` and implements `NMWebParams` for parameter handling.
