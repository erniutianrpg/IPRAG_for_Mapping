This code defines an abstract class `YarnRPC` that serves as a factory for creating RPC (Remote Procedure Call) clients and servers in Apache YARN. It provides methods to get a proxy (client) and a server instance for a given protocol, along with a static `create()` method that instantiates the concrete RPC implementation based on the configuration. The default implementation is specified in `YarnConfiguration`. Essentially, it abstracts the RPC mechanism used in YARN for communication between components.
