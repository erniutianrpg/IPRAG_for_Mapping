The `LogAggregationService` is a YARN NodeManager service that handles log aggregation for containers. It manages application log directories, aggregates logs from local directories to a remote filesystem (like HDFS), and ensures proper permissions. Key functionalities include:

1. Initializing remote log directories with correct permissions
2. Starting log aggregation for applications and containers
3. Handling log retention policies
4. Aggregating logs asynchronously using a thread pool
5. Cleaning up when applications finish

The service processes events for application start/stop and container completion to manage log aggregation lifecycle. It works with Hadoop's security model (UserGroupInformation) to ensure secure log handling.
