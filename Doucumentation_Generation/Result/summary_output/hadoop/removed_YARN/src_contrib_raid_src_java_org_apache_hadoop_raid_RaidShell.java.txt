The `RaidShell` is a command-line utility for interacting with Hadoop's RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) functionality. It provides several commands:

1. `-showConfig`: Displays configured RAID policies
2. `-recover`: Recovers corrupted files using parity data
3. `-recoverBlocks`: Recovers corrupted blocks of specified files
4. `-fsck`: Checks the file system for corrupt files and lists them

The tool connects to a RaidNode server via RPC, handles retries for failed operations, and includes methods to verify file integrity by checking both data and parity blocks. It's part of Hadoop's RAID implementation for data redundancy and recovery.
