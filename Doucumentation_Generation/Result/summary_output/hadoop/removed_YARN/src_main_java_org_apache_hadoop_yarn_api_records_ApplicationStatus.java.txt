This code defines an unstable, internal-use interface `ApplicationStatus` for tracking YARN application status. It provides getter/setter methods for: (1) application attempt ID, (2) response ID (likely a sequence number), and (3) progress percentage (as a float). The interface is marked as private/unstable, indicating it's for Hadoop internal use and may change. It's part of Apache Hadoop's YARN API for managing application resources.
