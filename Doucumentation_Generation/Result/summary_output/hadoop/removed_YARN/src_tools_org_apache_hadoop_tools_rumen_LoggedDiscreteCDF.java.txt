The `LoggedDiscreteCDF` class represents a discrete approximation of a cumulative distribution function (CDF) for JSON serialization. It stores the number of values, minimum/maximum values, and a list of relative rankings. The `setCDF` method constructs the CDF from histogram data. The class provides getters/setters for these properties and implements deep comparison (`DeepCompare`) to check equality of all fields, including nested rankings. This is primarily used for logging and analyzing distribution data in Hadoop.
