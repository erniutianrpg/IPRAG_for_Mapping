This code implements a Protocol Buffers (PB) wrapper class `QueueUserACLInfoPBImpl` for Hadoop YARN's `QueueUserACLInfo` interface. It provides methods to get/set a queue name and user ACLs (Access Control Lists) for a YARN queue, converting between PB and Java formats. The class handles proto serialization/deserialization and maintains local state for user ACLs, ensuring thread-safe operations when merging changes back to the proto format.
