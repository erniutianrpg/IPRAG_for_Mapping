This code defines the `RMAppAttempt` interface in Apache Hadoop YARN, which represents an application attempt in the Resource Manager. It provides methods to access attempt details like ID, state, host, RPC port, tracking URLs, client token, diagnostics, progress, final status, and resource usage. It also manages containers (including finished ones) and nodes used by the attempt, and provides the application submission context. The interface extends `EventHandler` to handle state transition events for application attempts.
