The code implements a Hadoop YARN RPC (Remote Procedure Call) system using Protocol Buffers for Java-to-Java communication. It provides methods to create both client proxies (`getProxy`) and server instances (`getServer`) for specified protocols. The implementation leverages Hadoop's RPC framework with custom factories (obtained via `RpcFactoryProvider`) to handle the communication. While it doesn't support cross-language compatibility, it uses Protocol Buffers for versioning within Java RPCs. The class handles configuration, security (via `SecretManager`), and connection details for both client and server setups.
