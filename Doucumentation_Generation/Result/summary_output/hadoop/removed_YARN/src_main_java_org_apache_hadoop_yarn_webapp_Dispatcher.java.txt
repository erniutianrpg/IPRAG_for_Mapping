The `Dispatcher` servlet routes HTTP requests to appropriate controllers based on predefined routes in a YARN web application. It handles request processing, error management (including redirects to error pages), cookie management, and parameter extraction. It supports dev mode features like server restart and provides standard HTTP method handling (GET, POST, OPTIONS). The servlet uses dependency injection (Guice) to manage controllers and views, ensuring proper request context setup and response rendering.
