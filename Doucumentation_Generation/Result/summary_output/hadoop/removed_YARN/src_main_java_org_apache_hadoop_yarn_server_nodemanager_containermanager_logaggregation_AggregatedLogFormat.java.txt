This code provides log aggregation functionality in Hadoop YARN's NodeManager. It defines classes for writing and reading aggregated container logs in a compressed TFile format. Key components include:

1. `LogWriter` - Aggregates logs from local directories into a remote file, handling application metadata (owner, ACLs) and container logs.
2. `LogReader` - Reads aggregated log files, providing access to application metadata and container logs.
3. `LogKey`/`LogValue` - Represent container identifiers and their log data.

The code handles log compression, versioning, and access control while efficiently storing and retrieving logs from multiple containers in a single aggregated file. It's part of YARN's log management system for distributed applications.
