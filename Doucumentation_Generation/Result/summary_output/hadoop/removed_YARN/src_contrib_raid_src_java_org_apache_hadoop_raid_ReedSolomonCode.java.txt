This code implements a Reed-Solomon erasure code for error correction. It can encode data into parity symbols and decode/reconstruct data when some symbols are lost. The class handles Galois Field arithmetic, generating polynomials, and Vandermonde systems for encoding and decoding. Key parameters include stripe size (data chunks) and parity size (redundancy chunks). The `encode()` method computes parity from input data, while `decode()` reconstructs erased data using parity information. It operates within a finite field defined by `GaloisField`.
