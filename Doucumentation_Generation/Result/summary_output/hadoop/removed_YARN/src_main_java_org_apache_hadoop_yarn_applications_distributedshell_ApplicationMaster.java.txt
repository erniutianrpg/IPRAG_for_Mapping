This code implements a YARN ApplicationMaster that executes shell commands across multiple containers in a distributed environment. Key functionalities include:

1. Registers with ResourceManager (RM) and requests containers with specified resources
2. Launches containers via ContainerManager to execute shell commands/scripts
3. Tracks container status (allocated, completed, failed)
4. Handles heartbeats with RM and manages container lifecycle
5. Cleans up and reports final status to RM upon completion

The ApplicationMaster acts as a framework for distributed shell command execution, managing resource allocation and task distribution across a YARN cluster. It demonstrates how to build YARN applications by implementing core AM-RM interactions.
