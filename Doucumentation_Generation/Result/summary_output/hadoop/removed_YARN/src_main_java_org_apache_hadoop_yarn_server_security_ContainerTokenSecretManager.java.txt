This code implements a `ContainerTokenSecretManager` for Hadoop YARN that manages secret keys for container tokens. It generates and stores unique secret keys per NodeManager host (master) and allows slaves to set received keys. The class provides methods to create and validate container tokens by generating/retrieving passwords using these keys, ensuring secure communication between YARN components. The secret keys are stored in a map keyed by hostnames.
