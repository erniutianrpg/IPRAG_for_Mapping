The `ContainerExitEvent` class represents an event triggered when a container exits in a YARN NodeManager. It extends `ContainerEvent` and adds an `exitCode` field to indicate the container's exit status. The class provides a constructor to initialize the container ID, event type, and exit code, along with a getter method (`getExitCode()`) to retrieve the exit code. This event is used to notify about container termination with its exit status. (98 words)
