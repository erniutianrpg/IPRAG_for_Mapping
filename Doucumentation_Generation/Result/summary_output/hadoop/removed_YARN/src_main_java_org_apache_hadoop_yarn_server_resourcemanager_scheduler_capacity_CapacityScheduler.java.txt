The `CapacityScheduler` is a YARN scheduler that manages cluster resources by dividing them into queues with configurable capacities. Key functionalities include:

1. Queue Management: Hierarchical queues with capacity guarantees
2. Resource Allocation: Allocates containers to applications based on queue capacities and fairness
3. Application Lifecycle: Handles application submission, resource requests, and completion
4. Node Management: Tracks node additions/removals and handles container allocations
5. Dynamic Configuration: Supports queue reconfiguration without restart

It maintains queue hierarchies, enforces capacities, and ensures resources are shared fairly among applications within queues. The scheduler handles various events like node updates, application submissions, and container completions while maintaining cluster resource utilization.
