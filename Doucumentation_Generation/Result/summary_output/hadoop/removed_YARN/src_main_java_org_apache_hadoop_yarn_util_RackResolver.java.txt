The `RackResolver` class resolves hostnames to network topology nodes (racks) in Hadoop. It initializes a DNS-to-switch mapping implementation (default: `ScriptBasedMapping`) from configuration. The `resolve()` methods take a hostname and return a `Node` object containing the hostname and its resolved rack location. The class ensures initialization occurs only once and provides thread-safe resolution of hostnames to rack locations.
