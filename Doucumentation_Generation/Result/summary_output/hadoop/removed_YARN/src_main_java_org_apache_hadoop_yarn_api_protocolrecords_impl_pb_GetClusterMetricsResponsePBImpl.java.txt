This code implements a Protocol Buffers (PB) based class `GetClusterMetricsResponsePBImpl` that represents a response containing YARN cluster metrics. It extends `ProtoBase` and handles conversion between PB formats and Java objects. The class manages cluster metrics data (like node counts, container stats) through getter/setter methods, maintains a builder for PB serialization, and ensures proper proto conversion between formats. It's part of Hadoop YARN's API for retrieving cluster status information.
