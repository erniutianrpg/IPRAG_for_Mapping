The `LocalRaidNode` class extends `RaidNode` to implement local file raiding (data redundancy) functionality. It overrides two methods: `raidFiles()` to perform the raiding operation on specified files using the given policy, and `getRunningJobsForPolicy()` which returns 0 (indicating no running jobs for any policy). This class is part of the Hadoop RAID system for distributed storage fault tolerance. (98 words)
