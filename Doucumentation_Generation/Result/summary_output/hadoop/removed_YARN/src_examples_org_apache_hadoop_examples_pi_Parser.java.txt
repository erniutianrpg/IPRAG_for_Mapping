This code is a parser for calculating π (pi) using the Bellard formula in a distributed computing environment. It:

1. Parses input files/directories containing partial computation results
2. Combines and sorts these partial results
3. Writes combined results to output files
4. Computes the final π value using Bellard's formula
5. Prints statistics including computation time and π value

The parser handles task results from distributed workers, combines them, and calculates the final π approximation. It supports verbose logging and can output processed results to specified directories.
