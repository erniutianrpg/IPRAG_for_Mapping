The `ContainerTokenSelector` class is a Hadoop YARN component that selects a container token from a collection of tokens. It implements `TokenSelector` to find a token matching a specific service name and of type `ContainerTokenIdentifier`. The `selectToken` method iterates through the tokens, checks if each token matches the required kind (`ContainerTokenIdentifier.KIND`) and service name, and returns the matching token or null if none is found. Debug logging is included for troubleshooting.
