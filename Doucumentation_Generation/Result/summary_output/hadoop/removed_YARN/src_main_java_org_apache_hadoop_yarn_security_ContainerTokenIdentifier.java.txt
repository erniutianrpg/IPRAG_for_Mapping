This code defines a `ContainerTokenIdentifier` class for Hadoop YARN, which represents a security token for container access. It stores container ID, NodeManager host address, and resource allocation details. The class implements serialization methods (`write` and `readFields`) for RPC communication and extends `TokenIdentifier` for authentication purposes. It also includes a `Renewer` inner class for token renewal. The token helps secure container operations in a YARN cluster.
