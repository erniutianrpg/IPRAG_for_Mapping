This code defines a `ContainerStartMonitoringEvent` class in Hadoop YARN, which represents an event to start monitoring a container's resource usage. It extends `ContainersMonitorEvent` and stores virtual memory (`vmemLimit`) and physical memory (`pmemLimit`) limits for a specific container (identified by `ContainerId`). The class provides getter methods to access these memory limits. Essentially, it's a data structure used to initiate container resource monitoring in the Node Manager. (98 words)
