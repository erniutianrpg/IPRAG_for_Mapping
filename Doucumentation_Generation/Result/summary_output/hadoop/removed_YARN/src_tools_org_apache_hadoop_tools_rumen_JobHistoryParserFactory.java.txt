This code provides a factory (`JobHistoryParserFactory`) to detect and instantiate the appropriate job history parser based on the input stream's version. It uses an enum (`VersionDetector`) with implementations for different Hadoop versions (e.g., Hadoop 2.0 and Current) to check if the input can be parsed (`canParse`) and create the corresponding parser (`newInstance`). If no suitable parser is found, it throws an `IOException`. The factory ensures the correct parser is selected for the job history format.
