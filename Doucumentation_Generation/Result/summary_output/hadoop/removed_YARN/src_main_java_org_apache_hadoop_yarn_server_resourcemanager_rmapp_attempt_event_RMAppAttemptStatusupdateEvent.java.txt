This code defines an `RMAppAttemptStatusupdateEvent` class, which is an event in Hadoop YARN that represents an application attempt's status update. It extends `RMAppAttemptEvent` and carries the application attempt ID and its current progress (a float value between 0 and 1). The event type is `STATUS_UPDATE`, and the progress can be retrieved via the `getProgress()` method. This event is used to track and update the progress of running applications in the ResourceManager.
