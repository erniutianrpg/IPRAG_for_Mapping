This code defines a `LocalizerResourceRequestEvent` class in Hadoop YARN, which signals the `ResourceLocalizationService` to fetch a specific resource. The event contains the resource details (`LocalizedResource`), its visibility (`LocalResourceVisibility`), and context (`LocalizerContext`). It extends `LocalizerEvent` and is triggered with a `REQUEST_RESOURCE_LOCALIZATION` type. The class provides getter methods to access these attributes. Essentially, it facilitates resource localization for containers in a YARN NodeManager.
