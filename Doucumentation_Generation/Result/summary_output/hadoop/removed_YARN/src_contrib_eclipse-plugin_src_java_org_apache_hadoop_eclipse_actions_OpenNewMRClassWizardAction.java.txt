This code defines an Eclipse plugin action `OpenNewMRClassWizardAction` that opens different MapReduce class creation wizards (Mapper, Reducer, or Driver) based on the input parameter. It implements `ICheatSheetAction` to integrate with Eclipse cheat sheets. The action checks the parameter type, initializes the corresponding wizard (NewMapperWizard, NewReducerWizard, or NewDriverWizard), displays it in a dialog, and returns success/failure status.
