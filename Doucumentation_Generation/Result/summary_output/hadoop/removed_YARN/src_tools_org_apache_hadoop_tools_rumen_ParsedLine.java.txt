The `ParsedLine` class parses log lines into key-value pairs. It extracts a log record type from the beginning of each line, then processes the remaining content as properties in `key="value"` format using regex pattern matching. The class provides methods to access the log type and retrieve property values as strings or longs. The parsing handles escaped characters in quoted values and avoids regex backtracking issues.
