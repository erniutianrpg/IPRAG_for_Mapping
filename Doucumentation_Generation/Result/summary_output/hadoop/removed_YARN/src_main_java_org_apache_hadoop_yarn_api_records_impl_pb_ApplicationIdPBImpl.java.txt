This code implements a Protocol Buffers (PB) based wrapper for `ApplicationId` in Hadoop YARN. It provides methods to get/set application ID and cluster timestamp, converting between PB and Java representations. The class maintains a builder pattern for constructing PB messages and handles proto conversions efficiently with synchronization for thread safety. It's essentially a bridge between YARN's Java API and its Protocol Buffers serialization format.
