This code implements a generic state machine framework that allows defining and executing state transitions based on events. Key features:

1. Allows building state machines by adding transitions between states triggered by events
2. Supports both single-arc (deterministic) and multiple-arc (non-deterministic) transitions
3. Provides thread-safe operation through synchronization
4. Can generate a visual graph of the state machine
5. Uses generics to work with any state/enum types and operands
6. Maintains immutability when adding new transitions (returns new factory instances)

The main components are:
- StateMachineFactory: Builds state machine definitions
- InternalStateMachine: Executes transitions
- Transition interfaces: Handle state change logic

The framework is designed for modeling complex stateful systems with clear transition rules.
