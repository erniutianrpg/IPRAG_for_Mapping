The `TypedBytesInput` class provides functionality for reading typed bytes sequences from a `DataInput` stream. It interprets the first byte as a type code and reads subsequent bytes accordingly, converting them into appropriate Java objects (like bytes, bools, integers, strings, vectors, lists, maps) or raw byte arrays. The class supports thread-local instances and handles various data types with specific methods for each type, including reading headers for complex types like vectors and maps. It throws exceptions for unknown types and handles EOF conditions gracefully.
