This code provides utility methods for converting between Hadoop YARN's Java objects and their Protocol Buffer (protobuf) representations. It handles various YARN-specific types like ContainerState, ApplicationStatus, ResourceUsageReports, QueueACLs, and others. Each conversion pair includes methods to convert to protobuf format (`convertToProtoFormat`) and back to Java objects (`convertFromProtoFormat`). The utility also handles ByteBuffer/ByteString conversions for raw data. This facilitates serialization/deserialization when using protobuf for RPC or storage in YARN.
