This code defines an `RMAppAttemptContainerFinishedEvent` class, which is an event in Hadoop YARN that signals when a container finishes execution. It extends `RMAppAttemptEvent` and contains the container's status. The event is triggered with the container's completion status and the associated application attempt ID, using the event type `CONTAINER_FINISHED`. The class provides a getter method to retrieve the container's status. This event is part of YARN's resource management for handling container lifecycle events.
