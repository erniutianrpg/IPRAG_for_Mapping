This code defines the `RegisterApplicationMasterResponse` interface in Hadoop YARN, which provides critical resource information to an ApplicationMaster upon registration. It includes methods to get/set the minimum and maximum resource capabilities in the cluster, as well as application access control lists (ACLs). The interface is marked as public and stable for core methods, while setter methods are private and unstable.
