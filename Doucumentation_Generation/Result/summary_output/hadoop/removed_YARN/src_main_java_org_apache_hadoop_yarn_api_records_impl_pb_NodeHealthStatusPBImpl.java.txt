This code implements a Protocol Buffers (PB) representation of a NodeHealthStatus in Hadoop YARN. It provides methods to get/set node health status (healthy/unhealthy), health report message, and last health report timestamp. The class handles conversion between PB protocol format and Java object, maintaining a builder pattern for efficient proto construction. It extends ProtoBase for common proto functionality and implements the NodeHealthStatus interface.
