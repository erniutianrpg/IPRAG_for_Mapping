The `ResourceTrackerService` is a YARN service that manages communication between the ResourceManager and NodeManagers. It handles NodeManager registration and heartbeats, validating nodes against an allow/exclude list, tracking node liveness, and managing container tokens. It responds to registration requests with approval or shutdown commands, processes heartbeats to monitor node health, and maintains node status. The service also implements security through Kerberos authentication and ACLs. It runs as an RPC server listening for NodeManager connections.
