This code defines an interface `GetAllApplicationsResponse` in Hadoop YARN's API. It provides methods to retrieve and set a list of `ApplicationReport` objects, which contain details about all applications managed by the ResourceManager. The reports include information like user, queue, application name, host, RPC port, tracking URL, and diagnostics. The interface is marked as public and stable for the getter method, while the setter is private and unstable for internal use.
