The `VerticaRecord` class is a serializable wrapper for database records from Vertica. It handles reading and writing data between Vertica ResultSets and Hadoop's Writable interface, supporting various SQL data types (integers, strings, dates, binaries, etc.). It provides methods to get/set values by index or name, convert records to SQL strings, and serialize/deserialize data for Hadoop MapReduce jobs. The class includes type validation and conversion between Java objects and their SQL representations.
