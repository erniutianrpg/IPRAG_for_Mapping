This code implements an `AuxServices` manager for YARN NodeManager that handles auxiliary services. It loads auxiliary services from configuration during initialization, manages their lifecycle (init, start, stop), and handles application-level events (init and stop). The services can provide metadata and are tracked in synchronized maps. The class also implements service state monitoring and event handling for auxiliary service operations.
