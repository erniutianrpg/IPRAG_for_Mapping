The `LocalResourceRequest` class represents a request for local resources in Hadoop YARN's NodeManager. It encapsulates resource details like path, timestamp, type, and visibility. The class implements `Comparable` for ordering, provides equality checks based on path, timestamp, and type, and includes methods to access resource properties. It's immutable (setter methods throw exceptions) and serves as a key for identifying and comparing localized resources in the cache. The class converts between YARN URLs and file system paths.
