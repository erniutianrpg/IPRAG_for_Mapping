This code defines an `RMAppRejectedEvent` class, which is an event type in Hadoop YARN's ResourceManager. It signals that an application (identified by `ApplicationId`) has been rejected, along with a rejection message. The class extends `RMAppEvent` and includes a constructor to set the application ID and rejection message, plus a getter method to retrieve the message. This event is triggered when the ResourceManager cannot accept an application submission. (98 words)
