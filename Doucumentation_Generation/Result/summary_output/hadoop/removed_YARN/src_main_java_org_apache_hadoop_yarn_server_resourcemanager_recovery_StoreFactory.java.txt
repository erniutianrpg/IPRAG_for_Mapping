This code provides a factory class `StoreFactory` for creating storage instances in YARN's ResourceManager. It has two main functions: 
1. `getStore()` creates a storage instance (defaulting to `MemStore`) based on configuration.
2. `createVoidAppStore()` returns a no-op `VoidApplicationStore` that implements `ApplicationStore` interface with empty methods, used when logging is disabled. The store handles application/container data persistence for recovery purposes.
