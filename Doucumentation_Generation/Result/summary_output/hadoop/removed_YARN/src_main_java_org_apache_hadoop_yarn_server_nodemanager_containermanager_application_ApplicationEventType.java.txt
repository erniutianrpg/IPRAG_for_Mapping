This code defines an enum `ApplicationEventType` that represents various event types in a YARN NodeManager's application management. The events include application initialization, container initialization, application completion, resource cleanup, container finish, and log handling completion. These events originate from different components like ContainerManager, ResourceLocalizationService, containers, and log handlers, tracking the lifecycle of applications in the NodeManager.
