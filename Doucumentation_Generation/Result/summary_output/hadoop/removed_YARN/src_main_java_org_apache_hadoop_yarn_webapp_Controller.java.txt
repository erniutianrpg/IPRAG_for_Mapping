This code defines an abstract `Controller` class for handling web requests in a YARN web application. It provides request/response context management, parameter handling, cookie management, and rendering capabilities for different response types (JSON, text, views). The controller supports dependency injection, status code handling, and utility methods for URL generation and content rendering. It serves as a base class for specific web controllers to implement actions (like `index()`) and handle HTTP requests.
