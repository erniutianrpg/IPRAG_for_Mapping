The `TraceBuilder` class is a Hadoop tool that processes job history logs and configurations to generate two outputs: a job trace (logged job information) and a network topology. It handles input paths (including recursive directory traversal), sorts history files, parses job configurations and history events using demuxers and parsers, and writes outputs using configurable outputters. The tool supports various input formats and includes error handling for file processing.
