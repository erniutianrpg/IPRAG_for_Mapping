The `Logalyzer` is a Hadoop utility for archiving and analyzing log files. It provides two main functions:  
1. **Archiving**: Copies log files from a specified URI to a Hadoop DFS directory using `DistCp`.  
2. **Analysis**: Performs log analysis via a MapReduce job that greps for a regex pattern, counts matches, and sorts results by specified columns using a custom `LogComparator`.  

Usage involves command-line arguments for input/output paths, grep patterns, and sort columns. The tool leverages Hadoop's `TextInputFormat` and `TextOutputFormat` for processing.
