The `ResourceRetentionSet` class manages local resource retention in a NodeManager. It tracks resource usage and deletes least-recently-used (LRU) resources when the total size exceeds a target threshold. Resources with active references are always retained. The LRU ordering is determined by resource timestamps. The class uses a `DeletionService` to handle actual resource deletion and maintains statistics on current and deleted resource sizes.
