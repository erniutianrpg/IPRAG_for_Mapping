This code defines an abstract `ContainerId` class in Hadoop YARN that represents a unique identifier for a container in a cluster. It provides methods to get/set the associated `ApplicationAttemptId` and container ID, along with thread-safe number formatting for string representation. The class implements `Comparable`, `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and a standardized `toString()` format. The ID follows a hierarchical structure: cluster timestamp, application ID, attempt ID, and container ID.
