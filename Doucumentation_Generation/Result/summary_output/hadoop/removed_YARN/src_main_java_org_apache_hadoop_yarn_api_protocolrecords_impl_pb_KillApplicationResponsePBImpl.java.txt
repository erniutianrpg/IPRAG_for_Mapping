This code implements a Protocol Buffers (PB) message class `KillApplicationResponsePBImpl` for Hadoop YARN's application termination response. It extends `ProtoBase` and handles conversion between PB objects and Java objects, managing a builder pattern for constructing the response. The class can be initialized either empty or with an existing proto, and ensures proper proto/builder state management via the `maybeInitBuilder()` and `getProto()` methods. It represents the response to a YARN application kill request. (98 words)
