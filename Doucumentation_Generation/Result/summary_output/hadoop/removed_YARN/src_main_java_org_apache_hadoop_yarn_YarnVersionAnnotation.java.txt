The code defines a Java annotation `@YarnVersionAnnotation` that captures Yarn's build information, including version, user who compiled it, date, repository URL, revision number, branch name, and source checksum. This annotation is retained at runtime and can be applied only to packages. It's marked as unstable and intended for limited internal use within Yarn and MapReduce components.
