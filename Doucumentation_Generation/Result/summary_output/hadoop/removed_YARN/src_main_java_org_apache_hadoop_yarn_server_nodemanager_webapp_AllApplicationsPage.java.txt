This code defines a web page (`AllApplicationsPage`) for Apache Hadoop YARN's Node Manager that displays all applications running on the node. The page uses jQuery DataTables for presentation and shows two columns: Application ID (as a clickable link) and Application State. The `AllApplicationsBlock` class fetches application data from the Node Manager context and renders it in an HTML table. The page is part of the Node Manager's web interface under the Apache License 2.0.
