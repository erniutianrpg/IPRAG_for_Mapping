The `AuxServicesEvent` class represents an event in Hadoop YARN's Node Manager for auxiliary services. It extends `AbstractEvent` and contains information about the event type, user, application ID, service ID, and service data. The class provides getter methods to access these fields and constructors to initialize them. This event is used to communicate auxiliary service-related operations (like initialization or stopping) between components in the YARN Node Manager.
