This code implements an `ApplicationTokenSecretManager` for managing security tokens in Hadoop YARN. It extends `SecretManager` to handle `ApplicationTokenIdentifier` tokens. The class maintains a single `masterKey` for generating and validating tokens, with methods to create passwords from identifiers and retrieve passwords. Currently, it uses one permanent master key, but TODOs indicate plans to enhance security by adding key expiry, multiple keys, and improved key management. The class provides basic token creation and validation functionality for YARN applications.
