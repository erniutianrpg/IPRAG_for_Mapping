This code provides utility methods for generating HTML elements with JSON data in a YARN web application. It includes functions to:  
1. Create progress bars with percentage titles (`appendProgressBar`)  
2. Make values sortable in tables (`appendSortable`)  
3. Generate hyperlinks from parts (`appendLink`)  
All methods output HTML via a `PrintWriter`. The code is part of Apache Hadoop's YARN web interface.
