This code implements a Hadoop RaidNode, which provides distributed RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) functionality for HDFS. Key features:

1. Creates parity files for HDFS data using XOR or Reed-Solomon erasure coding to provide fault tolerance
2. Reduces storage overhead by lowering replication factor after creating parity
3. Includes components for:
   - Periodic policy-based RAID operations
   - Corrupt block recovery using parity files
   - Deleting obsolete parity files
   - Creating HAR (Hadoop Archive) files of parity data
   - Fixing corrupt blocks

The RaidNode runs as a daemon that continuously monitors configured policies, generates parity files, and maintains the RAID system. It can recover data when blocks are corrupted by using the parity information. The implementation supports both XOR and Reed-Solomon encoding schemes with configurable stripe lengths.

The code handles distributed coordination when running in a cluster and provides RPC interfaces for administration and recovery operations. It's designed as an abstract base class that can be extended for different deployment scenarios.
