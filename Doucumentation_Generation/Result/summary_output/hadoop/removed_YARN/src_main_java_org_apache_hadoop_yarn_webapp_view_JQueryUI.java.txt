This code provides a JQueryUI utility class for a Hadoop YARN web application. It handles rendering and initialization of various UI components (accordions, data tables, dialogs, progress bars, theme switcher) using JQuery and JQueryUI libraries. The class includes methods to configure these components, manage themes via cookies, and generate JavaScript initialization code. It also provides helper methods for table initialization and progress display. The render method sets up required CSS and JavaScript resources and initializes components based on configuration parameters.
