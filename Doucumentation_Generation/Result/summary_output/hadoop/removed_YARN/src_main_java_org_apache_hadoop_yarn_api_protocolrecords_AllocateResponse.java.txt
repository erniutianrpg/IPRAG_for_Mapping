This code defines the `AllocateResponse` interface in Hadoop YARN, which represents the ResourceManager's response to an ApplicationMaster during resource allocation. The response includes an `AMResponse` object containing: a response ID, reboot flag, newly allocated containers, completed containers, and available cluster resources. The interface provides getter and setter methods for the `AMResponse`. It's marked as public and stable for API use.
