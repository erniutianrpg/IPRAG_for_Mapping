The `YarnScheduler` interface defines the core functionality for resource allocation and management in YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator). It allows components to interact with the scheduler to request resources, release containers, and query queue information. Key features include getting queue details and user ACLs, handling resource allocation requests from ApplicationMasters, obtaining node resource reports, and accessing scheduler application information. The interface also provides methods to retrieve minimum/maximum allocatable resources and root queue metrics. It serves as the main API between ApplicationMasters and the scheduler for managing cluster resources.
