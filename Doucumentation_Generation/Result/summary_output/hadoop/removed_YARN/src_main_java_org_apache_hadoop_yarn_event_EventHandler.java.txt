The code defines a generic Java interface `EventHandler<T>` for handling events of type `T` (where `T` extends `Event`). It declares a single method `handle(T event)` that must be implemented to process incoming events. This interface serves as a foundation for event-driven architectures, allowing different components to handle specific event types in a standardized way. (98 words)
