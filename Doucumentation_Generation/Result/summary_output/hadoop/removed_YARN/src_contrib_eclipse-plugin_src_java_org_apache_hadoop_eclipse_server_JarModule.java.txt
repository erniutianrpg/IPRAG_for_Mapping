This code provides functionality to create a JAR file containing Mapper/Reducer/Driver classes for a Hadoop MapReduce job from an Eclipse project. The `JarModule` class implements `IRunnableWithProgress` to package the specified resource (Java class with main()) and its dependencies into a JAR file. It handles JAR creation with progress monitoring, sets the main class in the manifest, and stores the JAR in a temporary location. The static `createJarPackage` method simplifies the process by showing a progress bar during JAR creation.
