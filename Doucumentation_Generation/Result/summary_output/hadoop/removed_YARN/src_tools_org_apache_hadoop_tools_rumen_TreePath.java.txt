The `TreePath` class represents a path from a node to the root in a tree structure, used for comparing trees in Rumen unit tests. It stores the parent path, field name, and optional array index. The `toString()` method generates a string representation of the path (e.g., "root-->field[1]-->subfield") to help identify discrepancies when trees don't match. The class supports both simple fields and array elements.
