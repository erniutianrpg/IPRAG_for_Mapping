This code is the activator class for an Eclipse plugin (Apache Hadoop Eclipse). It manages the plugin lifecycle, ensuring singleton instantiation through a synchronized constructor. On startup (`start()`), it initializes the plugin, and on shutdown (`stop()`), it disposes the ServerRegistry and clears the singleton instance. The `getDefault()` method provides access to the shared plugin instance. The plugin ID is defined as "org.apache.hadoop.eclipse".
