This code snippet establishes the package `org.apache.hadoop.yarn.factory.providers` as private (not intended for public use) through the `@InterfaceAudience.Private` annotation. It includes the necessary license header for Apache-licensed software and imports the `InterfaceAudience` classification from Hadoop's core libraries. The code doesn't implement any functionality but sets up package-level access restrictions.
