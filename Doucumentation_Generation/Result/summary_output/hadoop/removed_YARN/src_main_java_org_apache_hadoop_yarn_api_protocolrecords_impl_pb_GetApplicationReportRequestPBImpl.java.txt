This code implements a Protocol Buffers (PB) based request class for getting an application report in Hadoop YARN. It handles conversion between PB formats and Java objects, specifically for `ApplicationId`. The class manages a request proto message, provides getter/setter for the application ID, and ensures proper proto message building and merging between local and proto formats.
