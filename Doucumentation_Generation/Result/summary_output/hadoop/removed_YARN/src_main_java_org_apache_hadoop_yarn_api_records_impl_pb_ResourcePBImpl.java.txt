This code implements a Protocol Buffers (PB) based representation of a YARN `Resource` class, which typically represents cluster resources like memory. It provides methods to get/set memory values, convert between PB and Java objects, and compare resources based on memory. The class maintains a PB proto object internally and handles proto-builder initialization for modifications. It's part of Hadoop YARN's API for resource management.
