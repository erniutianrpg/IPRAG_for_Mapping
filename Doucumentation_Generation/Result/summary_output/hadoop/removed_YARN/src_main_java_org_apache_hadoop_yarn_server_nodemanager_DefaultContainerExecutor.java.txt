The `DefaultContainerExecutor` class is a Hadoop YARN component that manages container execution on NodeManagers. It handles:

1. Localizing containers by setting up user/app directories and copying required resources
2. Launching containers by preparing scripts, setting permissions, and executing them via shell commands
3. Managing container lifecycle through signal handling (start/stop)
4. Cleaning up container resources by deleting directories
5. Creating and managing log directories for applications and containers

It provides the default implementation for container operations in a Hadoop cluster, including directory creation, permission management, and process control. The class works with local filesystems and executes commands via shell interfaces.
