This code defines a Java interface `GetClusterMetricsResponse` for Hadoop YARN's client-RM protocol. It provides methods to get and set cluster metrics (`YarnClusterMetrics`), allowing clients to retrieve information about the cluster's resource usage and node status. The interface is marked as stable for public use, with the setter being private/unstable for internal use only. It's part of the response to a cluster metrics request via `ClientRMProtocol`.
