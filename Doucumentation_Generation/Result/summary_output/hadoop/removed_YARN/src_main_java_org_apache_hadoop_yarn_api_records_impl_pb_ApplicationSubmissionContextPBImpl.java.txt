This code implements a Protocol Buffers (PB) wrapper for `ApplicationSubmissionContext` in Hadoop YARN. It provides methods to get/set application submission details like ID, name, queue, user, priority, and AM container spec. The class handles conversion between PB and Java objects, maintaining a builder pattern for efficient proto construction. It extends `ProtoBase` to manage proto serialization/deserialization while exposing a clean Java API.
