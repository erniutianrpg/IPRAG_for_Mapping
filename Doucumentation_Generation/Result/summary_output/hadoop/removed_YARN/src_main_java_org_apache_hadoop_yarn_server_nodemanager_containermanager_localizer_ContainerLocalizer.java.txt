This code implements a `ContainerLocalizer` for Hadoop YARN, which localizes resources needed by containers. Key functionalities include:

1. Initializes directories for user/app cache and output
2. Downloads resources (files, archives) from HDFS to local storage based on resource visibility (PUBLIC, PRIVATE, APPLICATION)
3. Manages resource downloads via a thread pool
4. Communicates with NodeManager via heartbeats to report status and receive new resource requests
5. Handles credentials and security tokens for secure access
6. Cleans up resources when terminated

The localizer runs as a separate process to fetch and manage container dependencies before container execution.
