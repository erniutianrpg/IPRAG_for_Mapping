This code implements a MapReduce program to estimate the value of Pi using a quasi-Monte Carlo method. It generates random points in a unit square using a Halton sequence, counts points inside/outside an inscribed circle, and calculates Pi as 4*(numInside/numTotal). The mapper generates and counts points, while the reducer aggregates results. The final Pi estimation is computed by combining results from all mappers. The program uses Hadoop's distributed processing to handle large-scale computations efficiently.
