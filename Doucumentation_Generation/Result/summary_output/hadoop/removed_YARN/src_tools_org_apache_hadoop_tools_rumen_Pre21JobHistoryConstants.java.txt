This code defines constants and patterns for parsing Hadoop job history files from versions prior to 0.21. It includes enums for job history keys (like job ID, status, counters) and values (like SUCCESS, FAILED), along with regex patterns to match old and new versions of job history filenames and configuration filenames. The code helps in processing legacy Hadoop job history data.
