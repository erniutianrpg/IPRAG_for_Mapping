This code defines a `NewLocationAction` class that creates a wizard dialog for adding a new Hadoop server location in Eclipse. When triggered, it opens a modal wizard with a single page (`HadoopLocationWizard`) for configuring the server details. The action sets up the UI (text and icon) and handles the dialog creation, blocking until the user completes or cancels the operation. Upon finishing, it delegates to the wizard page's `performFinish()` method.
