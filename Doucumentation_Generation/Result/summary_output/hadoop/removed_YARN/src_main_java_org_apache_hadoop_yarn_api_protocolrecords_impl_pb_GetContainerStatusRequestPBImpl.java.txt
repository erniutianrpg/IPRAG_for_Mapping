This code implements a Protocol Buffers (PB) based request message for getting a container's status in Apache Hadoop YARN. It provides methods to:
1. Convert between PB and Java formats for container IDs
2. Get/set the container ID in the request
3. Manage proto buffer serialization/deserialization
4. Merge local changes into the proto buffer format

The class extends a base PB implementation and handles the conversion between YARN's container ID objects and their protocol buffer representations.
