This code provides an Ant task for testing HDFS conditions (like file existence or size) in build scripts. It extends `DfsTask` and implements Ant's `Condition` interface, allowing conditions such as `<hadoop:exists file="fileA"/>`. The class abstracts HDFS test commands (like `-e` for exists) via `getFlag()`, executes them, and returns the result through `eval()`. It enables HDFS condition checks in Ant build workflows.
