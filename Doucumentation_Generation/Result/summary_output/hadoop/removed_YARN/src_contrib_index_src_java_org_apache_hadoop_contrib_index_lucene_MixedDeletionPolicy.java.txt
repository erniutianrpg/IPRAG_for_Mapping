The `MixedDeletionPolicy` class implements Lucene's `IndexDeletionPolicy` to manage index commits across read-only and writable directories. It preserves all commits from initialization (`keepAllFromInit`) in the read-only directory, while for the writable directory, it retains only the latest commit and deletes older ones during `onCommit`. This hybrid approach ensures historical commits remain intact in the read-only section while maintaining a single current commit in the writable section.
