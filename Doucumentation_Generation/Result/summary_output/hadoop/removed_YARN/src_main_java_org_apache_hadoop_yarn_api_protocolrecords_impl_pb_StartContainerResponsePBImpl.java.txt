This code is a Protocol Buffers (PB) implementation of `StartContainerResponse` in Hadoop YARN. It handles the serialization/deserialization of container startup responses, particularly managing a map of service responses (String keys mapped to ByteBuffer values). The class converts between PB format and Java objects, provides methods to get/set/remove service responses, and maintains synchronization for thread safety. It extends `ProtoBase` for PB functionality.
