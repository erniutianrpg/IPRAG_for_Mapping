This code defines an enum `ApplicationAccessType` that specifies two types of application access permissions in a YARN (Hadoop) system: `VIEW_APP` for viewing application details and `MODIFY_APP` for modifying (e.g., killing) applications. It is part of the Apache Hadoop YARN API and is marked as stable and public for use by developers.
