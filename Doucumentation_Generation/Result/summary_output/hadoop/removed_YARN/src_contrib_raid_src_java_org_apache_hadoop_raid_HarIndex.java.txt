The `HarIndex` class parses and represents the contents of a Hadoop Archive (HAR) index file, which contains metadata about parity files stored in the archive. It reads the index file line by line, extracts file information (name, offset, length, modification time, and part file name), and stores it as `IndexEntry` objects. The class provides methods to find entries by part file and offset or by file name, enabling efficient lookup of archived file metadata. The index assumes the HAR contains only files (no directories).
