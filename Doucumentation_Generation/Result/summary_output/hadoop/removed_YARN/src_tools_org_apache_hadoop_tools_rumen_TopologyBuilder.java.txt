The `TopologyBuilder` class processes Hadoop job history events to construct a cluster topology. It extracts host information from three event types (`TaskAttemptFinishedEvent`, `TaskAttemptUnsuccessfulCompletionEvent`, and `TaskStartedEvent`), parses hostnames into `ParsedHost` objects, and stores them in a set. The `build()` method returns a `LoggedNetworkTopology` containing all unique hosts. Essentially, it analyzes task locations to map the cluster's network structure. (98 words)
