This code implements a Protocol Buffers (PB) based `StopContainerRequest` message for Apache Hadoop YARN. It provides functionality to: 
1. Store and manage a container stop request 
2. Convert between PB format and Java objects 
3. Get/set the container ID to be stopped 
4. Handle protocol buffer serialization/deserialization

The class extends `ProtoBase` and manages PB conversions for container IDs, maintaining both a builder and proto instance while ensuring thread-safe access.
