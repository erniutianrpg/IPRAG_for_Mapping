The `XOREncoder` class implements RAID-like XOR-based encoding for data redundancy. It extends an `Encoder` class to perform XOR operations across input data blocks (specified by `stripeSize`), generating parity data. The `encodeStripe` method reads input blocks, computes XOR parity, and writes it to an output stream. The parity data is stored in a temporary directory specified by `getParityTempPath`. This provides fault tolerance by enabling data recovery if a block is lost. The class uses Hadoop's filesystem APIs for distributed storage operations.
