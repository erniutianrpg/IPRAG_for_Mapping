The `Dispatcher` interface defines a simple event dispatching mechanism. It provides methods to get an event handler, and to register event handlers for specific event types (represented by enums). Implementations of this interface would route events to the appropriate registered handlers based on their types. This is a basic publish-subscribe pattern for event handling in the YARN framework.
