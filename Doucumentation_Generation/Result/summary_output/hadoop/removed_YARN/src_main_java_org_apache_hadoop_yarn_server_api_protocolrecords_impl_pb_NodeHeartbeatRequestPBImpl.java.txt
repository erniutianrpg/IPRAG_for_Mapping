This code implements a Protocol Buffers (PB) based class `NodeHeartbeatRequestPBImpl` that represents a node's heartbeat request in Hadoop YARN. It handles conversion between PB format and Java objects, specifically managing a `NodeStatus` object that tracks the node's state. The class provides methods to get/set the node status and ensures proper proto buffer serialization/deserialization through merge operations. It's part of YARN's internal node-to-resource-manager communication.
