This code defines an enum `ResourceEventType` that represents different types of events that can be delivered to a `LocalizedResource` in Apache Hadoop YARN's NodeManager. The enum includes three event types: `REQUEST` (for resource requests), `LOCALIZED` (for localized resources), and `RELEASE` (for resource releases). These events are used to manage the lifecycle of localized resources in the container management system. The code is part of the Hadoop YARN project and is licensed under Apache License 2.0.
