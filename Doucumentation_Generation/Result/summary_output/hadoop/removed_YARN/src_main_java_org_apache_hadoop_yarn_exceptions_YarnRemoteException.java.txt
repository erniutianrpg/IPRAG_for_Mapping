This code defines an abstract `YarnRemoteException` class that extends `IOException` for Hadoop YARN. It provides constructors for different exception scenarios and overrides `printStackTrace()` methods to include both remote and local stack traces. The class requires implementing `getRemoteTrace()` to retrieve remote exception details and `getCause()` to get the underlying exception. It serves as a base for YARN-specific remote exceptions.
