The `ApplicationContainerInitEvent` class represents an event sent from the `ContainerManagerImpl` to `ApplicationImpl` to request container initialization. It ensures container launches are delayed until the application is fully initialized. The event carries a `Container` object and converts to a `ContainerInitEvent` once the application is ready. This maintains proper application life-cycle management in YARN's NodeManager. (98 words)
