This code defines an abstract base class `DistTool` for distributed file operations in Hadoop. It provides common utility methods including: checking source file existence, reading/writing strings, reading files, and generating random IDs. The class implements Hadoop's `Tool` interface for configuration handling and includes error handling with custom exceptions like `DuplicationException`. It serves as a foundation for distributed file tools with basic file operations and validation.
