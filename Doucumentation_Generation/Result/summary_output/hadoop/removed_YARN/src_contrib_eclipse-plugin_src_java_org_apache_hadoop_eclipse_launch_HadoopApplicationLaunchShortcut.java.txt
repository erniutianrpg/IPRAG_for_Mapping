This code extends Eclipse's Java application launch shortcut to add a "Run on Hadoop" option. It creates or finds a launch configuration for a selected Java type, customizes the runtime classpath, and opens a wizard dialog to configure Hadoop-specific settings. The modified configuration is saved if changes are made, enabling users to run Java applications on Hadoop directly from Eclipse's Run menu. The code handles configuration setup and integrates with Eclipse's debugging and launch framework.
