This code provides a Zookeeper client library (ZKClient) for service registration and discovery. It allows registering/unregistering services with ephemeral nodes, listing registered services under a path, and retrieving service data. The class handles Zookeeper connections and converts Zookeeper exceptions to IOExceptions. It includes a basic watcher class (ZKWatcher) that currently does nothing with received events. The library is part of Apache Hadoop YARN and is licensed under Apache 2.0.
