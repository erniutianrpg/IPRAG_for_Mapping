This code defines a web page for displaying application-specific information in Apache Hadoop YARN's Node Manager. The `ApplicationPage` class extends `NMView` and renders an application's details including its ID, state, user, and associated containers. The `ApplicationBlock` inner class fetches application data from the Node Manager context and displays it in an HTML table format, with each container linked to its detailed page. The page uses jQuery DataTables for table styling and functionality.
