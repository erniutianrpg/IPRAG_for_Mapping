This code defines `RMAppAttemptEvent`, a Hadoop YARN class representing an event related to a specific application attempt. It extends `AbstractEvent` with `RMAppAttemptEventType` and stores an `ApplicationAttemptId`. The class provides a constructor to create events with an attempt ID and event type, and a getter to retrieve the attempt ID. Essentially, it's a simple event container for application attempt-related operations in YARN's ResourceManager. (98 words)
