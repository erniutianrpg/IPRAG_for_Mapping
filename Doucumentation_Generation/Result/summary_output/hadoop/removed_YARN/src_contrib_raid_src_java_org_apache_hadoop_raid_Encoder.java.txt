This code defines an abstract `Encoder` class for generating parity files in a Hadoop RAID system. Key functionalities include:

1. Encoding source files into parity files using configurable buffer sizes and stripe patterns
2. Recovering corrupted parity blocks by reconstructing from source data
3. Handling temporary file creation and cleanup during encoding
4. Providing abstract methods for concrete implementations to define specific encoding algorithms and temporary paths

The class manages file I/O operations, buffer allocation, and progress reporting while allowing subclasses to implement specific encoding logic through the `encodeStripe` method. It supports both file-to-file and stream-based operations.
