This code defines a `NodeRemovedSchedulerEvent` class, which is a scheduler event in Hadoop YARN indicating that a node (RMNode) has been removed from the cluster. The event carries the removed node's information (RMNode object) and has a type `NODE_REMOVED`. It provides a getter method `getRemovedRMNode()` to access the removed node's details. This event is used by the ResourceManager's scheduler to handle node removal. (98 words)
