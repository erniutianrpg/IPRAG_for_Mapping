This code implements the NodeManager service in Hadoop YARN, which manages containers (execution environments) on a single node. Key functionalities include:

1. Initializes core services like ContainerManager, NodeStatusUpdater, and WebServer
2. Handles container lifecycle management and resource monitoring
3. Manages security via token authentication and ACLs
4. Maintains application and container mappings
5. Provides health monitoring and metrics reporting
6. Communicates with the ResourceManager for resource allocation

The NodeManager acts as a per-node agent responsible for launching containers, monitoring their resource usage, and reporting status to the ResourceManager.
