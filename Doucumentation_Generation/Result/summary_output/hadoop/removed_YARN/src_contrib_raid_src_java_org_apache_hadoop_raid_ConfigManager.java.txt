The `ConfigManager` class manages RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) configuration for Hadoop by reading and periodically reloading an XML config file. It parses policies defined for source paths, including properties like replication factors and stripe lengths. The class supports dynamic reloading of configurations at specified intervals, maintains policy lists in memory, and provides thread-safe access to configuration parameters. Key features include policy inheritance, error handling for malformed configurations, and background thread-based automatic reloading.
