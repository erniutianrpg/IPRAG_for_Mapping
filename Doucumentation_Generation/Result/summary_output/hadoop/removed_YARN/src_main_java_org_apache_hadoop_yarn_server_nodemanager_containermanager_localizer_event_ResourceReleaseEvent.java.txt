The `ResourceReleaseEvent` class represents an event signaling the release of a localized resource associated with a specific container in YARN's NodeManager. It extends `ResourceEvent` with a `RELEASE` type and stores the `ContainerId` of the container releasing the resource. The class provides a getter method to retrieve the container ID. This event is part of YARN's resource localization mechanism. (94 words)
