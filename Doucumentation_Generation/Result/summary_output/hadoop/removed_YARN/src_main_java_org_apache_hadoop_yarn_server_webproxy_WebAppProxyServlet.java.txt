This code implements a proxy servlet for YARN web applications. It handles requests to access Application Master UIs by:

1. Validating the request and checking user permissions
2. Displaying security warnings when accessing another user's application
3. Proxying approved requests to the actual Application Master web interface
4. Handling redirects for finished/killed/failed applications
5. Managing cookies to track user approvals

The servlet acts as a security gateway, ensuring users are aware when accessing potentially unsafe interfaces while providing seamless access to authorized applications.
