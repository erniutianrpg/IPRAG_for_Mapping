This code defines an abstract `HtmlBlock` class for generating HTML content in a YARN web application. It extends `TextView` and implements `SubView`, providing a framework to render HTML blocks. The nested `Block` class (extending `Hamlet`) handles HTML generation with proper nesting levels. The main functionality includes rendering HTML content while maintaining correct nesting and inline context, with validation to ensure proper HTML structure. Concrete implementations must override the `render(Block html)` method to define specific HTML output.
