The `DeletionService` is a YARN NodeManager service that asynchronously deletes files/directories. It uses a thread pool to schedule deletion tasks, supporting both direct deletions (as the JVM user) and delegated deletions (as a specified user via `ContainerExecutor`). The service is configurable with thread count and optional debug delay. Deletions can target specific subdirectories within multiple base directories. The service properly handles shutdown by terminating pending tasks.
