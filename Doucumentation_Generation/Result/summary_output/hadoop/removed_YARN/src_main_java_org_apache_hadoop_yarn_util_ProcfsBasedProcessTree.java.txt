This code implements a Linux `/proc` filesystem-based process tree tracker for monitoring resource usage (CPU, memory) of a process and its children. Key functionalities include:

1. Constructs a process tree starting from a given PID by parsing `/proc/[pid]/stat` files
2. Tracks cumulative virtual memory (vmem) and resident memory (rss) usage
3. Calculates CPU time using jiffies (kernel time units)
4. Handles process hierarchies and updates process states/ages
5. Provides memory and CPU usage statistics for the entire process tree
6. Works only on Linux systems (validates OS)

The class is designed for internal Hadoop/YARN use to monitor container processes and their resource consumption.
