This code implements a Protocol Buffers (PB) based request class `GetQueueUserAclsInfoRequestPBImpl` for YARN's queue user ACLs information. It extends `ProtoBase` and handles conversion between PB objects and Java objects. The class maintains a proto instance and builder, with methods to get/set the proto representation. It's part of Hadoop YARN's API for requesting queue access control lists (ACLs) for users.
