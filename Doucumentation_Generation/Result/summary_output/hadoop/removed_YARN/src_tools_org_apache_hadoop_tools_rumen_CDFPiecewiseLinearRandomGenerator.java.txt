This code implements a piecewise linear random value generator based on a given cumulative distribution function (CDF). It extends `CDFRandomGenerator` to produce random values by linearly interpolating between discrete CDF data points. The generator can be initialized with or without a specific random seed. The `valueAt` method calculates a value for a given probability by finding the appropriate CDF segment and performing linear interpolation between its endpoints. Note that it assumes the empirical min/max values are absolute bounds.
