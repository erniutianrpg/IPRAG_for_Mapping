The `ContainerLogAppender` is a custom Log4j appender for Hadoop YARN container system logs. It writes logs to a specified directory (`containerLogDir`) in a file named "syslog". Key features include: 

1. Maintains a tail buffer of recent log events (size configurable via `maxEvents`) when enabled.
2. Appends new logs to the file while managing the tail buffer's size.
3. On close, flushes any remaining buffered events to the file.
4. Allows configuration of log file size via `setTotalLogFileSize()`, converting size to a max event count.

It ensures logs are persisted even if the container crashes.
