The `Histogram` class represents a distribution of long values, tracking their frequencies in a sorted map. It allows adding values (`enter()`), querying counts (`get()`), and iterating through value-count pairs. The key functionality is generating a cumulative distribution function (CDF) approximation via `getCDF()`, which returns value thresholds for specified percentile buckets. The class also provides methods to dump contents and get the total count of entered values. It's essentially a frequency counter with statistical analysis capabilities.
