The `ApplicationSubmissionContext` interface defines the metadata needed by YARN's ResourceManager to launch an ApplicationMaster for an application. It includes the application ID, name, queue, priority, submitting user, and the container launch context for the ApplicationMaster. The interface provides getter and setter methods for these properties, enabling configuration and submission of applications to the YARN cluster.
