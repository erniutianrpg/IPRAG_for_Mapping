The `JobMonitor` class is a thread that periodically monitors the status of distributed RAID jobs (stored in a map keyed by policy names). It checks job completion status, tracks succeeded/finished jobs, and removes completed jobs from monitoring. The class provides thread-safe methods to add/remove jobs and query job counts. It runs at configurable intervals (default 60 seconds) until stopped.
