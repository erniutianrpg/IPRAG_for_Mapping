The `ParityInputStream` class combines multiple input streams into a single stream that outputs the XOR of their contents. It reads data in chunks from each input stream, computes their XOR, and makes the result available for reading. The class handles stream management, buffer operations, and progress reporting, while ensuring exact byte reads (padding with zeros if a stream ends early). It's useful for parity calculations in distributed storage systems like Hadoop RAID.
