The `Summation` class represents a mathematical summation of terms (2^e mod n)/n, where `n` and `e` follow arithmetic progressions. It provides methods to compute the sum using modular or Montgomery arithmetic, combine summations, partition them into smaller parts, and compare/convert to strings. The class ensures progressions for `n` and `e` have equal steps and supports operations like value computation, combination of terms, and checking containment between summations.
