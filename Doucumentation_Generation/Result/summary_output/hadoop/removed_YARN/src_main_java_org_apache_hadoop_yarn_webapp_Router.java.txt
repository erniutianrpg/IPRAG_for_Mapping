The `Router` class manages path-to-controller routing in a web application. It maps HTTP paths to controller actions using a tree-based structure, supporting route registration (`add`), resolution (`resolve`), and default view handling. Routes are stored with their HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.), and the router performs prefix matching and parameter extraction. It also handles default controller/view resolution and supports security checks. The code is part of the Apache Hadoop YARN project's web framework.
