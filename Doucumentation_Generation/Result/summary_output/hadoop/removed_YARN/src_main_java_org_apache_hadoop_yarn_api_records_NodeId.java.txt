This code defines an abstract `NodeId` class in Hadoop YARN that uniquely identifies a node using a hostname and port. It provides methods to get/set these values and implements `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `compareTo()` for proper comparison and ordering. The class ensures node identity persists across NodeManager restarts. Annotations indicate public/private and stable/unstable APIs.
