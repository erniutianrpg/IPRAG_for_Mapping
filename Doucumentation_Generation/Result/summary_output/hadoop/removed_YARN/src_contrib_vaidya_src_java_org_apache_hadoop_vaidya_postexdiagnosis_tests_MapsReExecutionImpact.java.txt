This code defines a diagnostic test `MapsReExecutionImpact` that evaluates the impact of re-executed map tasks in a Hadoop job. It calculates the percentage of maps re-executed by comparing launched vs. total map tasks, then provides advice on potential causes (e.g., unstable nodes or application failures). The results include metrics like total maps, launched maps, and the calculated impact percentage. The test helps identify inefficiencies in map task execution.
