This code implements a Protocol Buffers (PB) wrapper class `LocalResourceStatusPBImpl` for managing local resource status in Hadoop YARN's NodeManager. It provides methods to get/set resource details (like local path, size, status), handles conversions between PB and Java objects, and manages exceptions. The class extends `ProtoBase` to handle PB serialization/deserialization for `LocalResourceStatusProto` messages, including fields for resource, local path, status, and error information.
