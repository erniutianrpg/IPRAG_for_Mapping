The `NavBlock` class generates a navigation sidebar for a web interface in Hadoop YARN's ResourceManager. It creates HTML elements for two sections: "Cluster" (with links to Cluster, Nodes, Applications, and Scheduler pages) and "Tools" (with links to Configuration, Logs, Server stacks, and Metrics). The navigation is structured as an HTML unordered list within div containers, including a theme switcher placeholder. This code is part of the YARN web application's UI components.
