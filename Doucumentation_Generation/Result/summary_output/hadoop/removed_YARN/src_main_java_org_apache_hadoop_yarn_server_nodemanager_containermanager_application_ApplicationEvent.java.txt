This code defines an `ApplicationEvent` class in Hadoop YARN's Node Manager, representing application-related events. It extends `AbstractEvent` with `ApplicationEventType` and contains an `ApplicationId` to identify the application. The class provides a constructor to create events with an application ID and event type, and a getter method to retrieve the application ID. Essentially, it's a simple event object used for tracking application state changes in YARN's container management system. (98 words)
