This code implements an abstract liveliness monitor that tracks heartbeat signals from registered objects. It runs a background thread (`PingChecker`) that periodically checks if any objects haven't sent a heartbeat within the `expireInterval` (default 5 minutes). If an object times out, it's removed and the abstract `expire()` method is called. Objects can be registered/unregistered, and their liveliness is updated via `receivedPing()`. The monitor interval is set to 1/3 of the expire interval for timely checks. This is commonly used for failure detection in distributed systems.
