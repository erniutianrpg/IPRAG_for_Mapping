This code implements a Protocol Buffers (PB) based `HeartbeatResponse` class for Hadoop YARN, which handles communication between NodeManagers and the ResourceManager. It manages response IDs, node actions (like shutdown), and lists of containers/applications to clean up. The class converts between PB formats and YARN records, providing methods to add, remove, and clear cleanup lists while maintaining synchronization between local objects and their PB representations.
