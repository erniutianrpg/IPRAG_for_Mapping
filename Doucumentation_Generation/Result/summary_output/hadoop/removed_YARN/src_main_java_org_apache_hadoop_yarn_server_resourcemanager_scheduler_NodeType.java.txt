This code defines an enumeration `NodeType` that classifies resource locations in a Hadoop YARN scheduler. It has three values: `NODE_LOCAL` (data is on the same node), `RACK_LOCAL` (data is on the same rack), and `OFF_SWITCH` (data is on a different rack or node). This helps the scheduler optimize task placement for data locality.
