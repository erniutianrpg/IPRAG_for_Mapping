The code defines a custom exception class `FailedDownloadException` that extends `AppException`. It's used to indicate a failed download attempt, specifically when an audio file isn't found. The constructor takes a filename as input and creates an error message in German stating that the specified audio file wasn't found. This exception is part of a media store application.
