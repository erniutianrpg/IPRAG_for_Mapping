This code defines a custom `FailedUploadException` class that extends `AppException`. It's used to indicate failures during file uploads in a media store application. The exception includes the filename that failed to upload and wraps the original cause (`Throwable`). The error message is formatted in German, stating "Error while saving the audio [filename]". This exception helps handle and communicate upload failures specifically.
