This module provides a comprehensive framework for a distributed media store application, implementing core functionality for audio file management with caching, conversion, and remote access capabilities. It includes EJB-based components for downloading and caching audio files, utility classes for file operations and format conversion (including MP3 encoding/decoding via LAME), and a configuration system for managing distributed components. The architecture supports both local and remote access patterns through carefully designed interfaces and exception handling, while the caching layer optimizes performance by reducing redundant downloads. The module serves as the foundation for a scalable media storage system with proper separation of concerns between business logic, data transfer objects, and infrastructure utilities.
