The `JNDIUtil` class provides a utility method `find()` to locate EJBs (Enterprise Java Beans) via JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface). It constructs the appropriate JNDI name based on whether the call is local or remote, using the provided interface (`ProvidedInterface`) and its configuration (`EJB`). The method initializes the context with properties, builds the JNDI path with app/module/bean details and interface type (Local/Remote), then performs the lookup. This simplifies EJB access in a distributed environment.
