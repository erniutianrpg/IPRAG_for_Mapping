The code defines a remote EJB (Enterprise JavaBean) interface `IDownloadCacheRemote` that extends the `IDownloadCache` interface. This marks it as a remotely accessible component in a distributed system, allowing clients to invoke its methods across JVM boundaries. The interface itself is empty, inheriting all functionality from `IDownloadCache`. The license header indicates it's part of the Media Store V3 system under GPLv3.
