This code provides a base class for EJBs (Enterprise Java Beans) in a media store application. It manages required interfaces through JNDI lookups, caching loaded interfaces to avoid repeated lookups. The `initRequiredInterface` method handles interface initialization, checking if the interface is already loaded or needs a new JNDI lookup. It supports both local and remote calls based on configuration. The class uses a configuration system (`Config`) to determine EJB details and maintains a cache of loaded interfaces in a `HashMap`.
