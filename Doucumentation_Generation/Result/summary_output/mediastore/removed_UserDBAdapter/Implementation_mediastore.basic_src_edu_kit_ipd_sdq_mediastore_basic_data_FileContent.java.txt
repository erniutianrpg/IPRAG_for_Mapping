The `FileContent` abstract class provides functionality to convert between local and remote file content representations. The `convertIfNeeded()` method checks if conversion is required (e.g., local to remote or vice versa) and performs it by either reading file bytes into memory (local→remote) or writing bytes to a temporary file (remote→local). It returns the converted object or the original if no conversion was needed. The class serves as a base for handling file content in different storage contexts.
