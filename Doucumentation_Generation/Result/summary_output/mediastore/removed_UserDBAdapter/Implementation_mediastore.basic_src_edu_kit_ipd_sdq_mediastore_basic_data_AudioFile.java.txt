The `AudioFile` class represents an audio file with metadata (stored in an `AudioFileInfo` object) and binary content (stored in a `FileContent` object). It provides getters and setters for audio file attributes like ID, album, artist, bitrate, genre, release year, title, uploader, and filename, which are delegated to the `AudioFileInfo` object. The class also manages the file's binary content. It is serializable for network transmission or storage.
