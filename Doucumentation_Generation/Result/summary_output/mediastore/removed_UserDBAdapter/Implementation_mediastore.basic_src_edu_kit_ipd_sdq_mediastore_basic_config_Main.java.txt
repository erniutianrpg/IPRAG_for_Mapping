This code creates a configuration file for EJBs (Enterprise Java Beans) in a media store application. It defines multiple EJBs with their provided and required interfaces, stores them in a map, and serializes this map to an XML file ("ejbconfig.xml") using XStream. Finally, it loads and prints the configuration to verify correctness. Essentially, it sets up and persists EJB dependency information for a modular Java EE application.
