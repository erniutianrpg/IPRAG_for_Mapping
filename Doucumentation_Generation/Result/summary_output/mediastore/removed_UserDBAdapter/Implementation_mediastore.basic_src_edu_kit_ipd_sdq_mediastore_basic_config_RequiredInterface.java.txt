The `RequiredInterface` class represents a required interface in a media store configuration. It stores a name (e.g., "IDownload") and a reference to a `ProvidedInterface` object. The class provides getters for these fields and a `toString()` method that formats the information as a string with indentation. It uses XStream annotations for XML serialization, with `@XStreamAlias` mapping the class to the "RequiredInterface" tag. (98 words)
