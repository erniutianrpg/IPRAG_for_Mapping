The `IdAndBitrate` class is a simple serializable Java bean that pairs a long ID with an integer bitrate. It provides getters/setters for both fields and overrides `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods to compare objects based on their ID and bitrate values. This class is likely used as a key or value object in caching scenarios within the Media Store application.
