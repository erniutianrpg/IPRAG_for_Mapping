The code defines a custom exception class `PropertiesException` that extends `AppException`. It provides two constructors: one that accepts an error message, and another that accepts both a message and a cause (another Throwable). This exception is used to handle property-related errors in the application, following standard Java exception patterns. The class includes a serial version UID for serialization compatibility.
