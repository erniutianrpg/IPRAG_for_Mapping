This code manages configuration settings for EJBs (Enterprise Java Beans) by loading them from an XML file (`ejbconfig.xml`). It uses XStream for XML deserialization, checks if the file has been modified before reloading, and caches the last modified timestamp to avoid unnecessary reloads. The `ejbs` map stores the configuration data, and `reconfigurable` indicates if dynamic reconfiguration is allowed. The main method `loadConfig()` handles the loading and updating of configurations.
