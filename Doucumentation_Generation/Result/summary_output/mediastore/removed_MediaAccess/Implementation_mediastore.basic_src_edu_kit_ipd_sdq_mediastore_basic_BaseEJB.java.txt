This code provides a base class for EJBs (Enterprise Java Beans) in a media store application. It manages required interfaces by either reusing already loaded interfaces or performing JNDI lookups to find and cache new ones. The `initRequiredInterface` method handles interface initialization, checking configurations, and caching results to avoid repeated JNDI lookups. It supports both local and remote calls based on the EJB's location. The class also includes a helper method `isLocal` to check if a cached interface is local. Overall, it simplifies EJB communication and interface management. (98 words)
