This code defines a custom exception `UserAlreadyExistsException` that extends `DbException`. It is thrown when a user attempts to register with an email that already exists in the database. The constructor takes the email as input and creates an error message indicating the duplicate email (in German: "existiert schon" meaning "already exists"). The exception is part of a media store application's basic exception handling.
