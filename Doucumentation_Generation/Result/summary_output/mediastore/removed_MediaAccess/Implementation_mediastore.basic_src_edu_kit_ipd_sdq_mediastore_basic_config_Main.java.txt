This Java code configures and serializes EJB (Enterprise JavaBean) components for a media store application. It creates multiple EJBs (like audiowatermarking, cache, facade), defines their provided and required interfaces, establishes dependencies between them, and stores this configuration in an XML file (`ejbconfig.xml`) using XStream for serialization. Finally, it loads and prints the configuration to verify the setup. The code essentially builds a dependency graph of EJBs for deployment.
