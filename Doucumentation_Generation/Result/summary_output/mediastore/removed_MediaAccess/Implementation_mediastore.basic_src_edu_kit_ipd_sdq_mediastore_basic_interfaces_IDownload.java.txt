The code defines an interface `IDownload` that extends `IBusinessInterface`. It declares a method `download` which takes a list of audio file IDs, bitrates, a downloader's login, and a local flag as parameters. The method returns a list of `AudioFile` objects and may throw `FailedDownloadException` or `NamingException`. This interface provides a contract for downloading audio files with specified bitrates, handling both local and remote operations.
