The `LameUtil` class provides utility methods for working with the LAME MP3 encoder/decoder. It initializes by copying `lame.exe` to the working directory if missing, and offers `encode()` and `decode()` methods to convert audio files with specified bitrates or decode MP3s. The `execLame()` method handles the actual execution of LAME commands. The class ensures proper file handling and process management for audio conversions.
