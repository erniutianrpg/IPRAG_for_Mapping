The `DbManager` class is a stateless EJB that manages audio file data in a database. It provides methods to: save audio file metadata, retrieve all audio file info, fetch specific audio by ID, clear the audio table (either entirely or except for a specific user), and get the total count of audio files. It uses JPA's `EntityManager` for database operations and handles exceptions like failed downloads. The class serves as a persistence layer for audio file information in a media store application.
