The `FileContent` abstract class provides functionality to convert between local and remote file content representations. Its `convertIfNeeded()` method checks if conversion is required (local to remote or vice versa) and performs it by reading/writing file bytes. Local content is stored as file paths, while remote content uses byte arrays. The method returns the converted content or the original object if no conversion is needed.
