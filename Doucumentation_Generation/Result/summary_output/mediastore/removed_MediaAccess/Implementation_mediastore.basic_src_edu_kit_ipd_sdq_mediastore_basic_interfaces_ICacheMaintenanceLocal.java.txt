The code defines a local EJB interface `ICacheMaintenanceLocal` that extends the `ICacheMaintenance` interface. It serves as a local (in-process) interface for cache maintenance operations within the Media Store system. The `@Local` annotation indicates it's designed for local access within the same JVM. The interface itself is empty, inheriting all functionality from its parent interface.
