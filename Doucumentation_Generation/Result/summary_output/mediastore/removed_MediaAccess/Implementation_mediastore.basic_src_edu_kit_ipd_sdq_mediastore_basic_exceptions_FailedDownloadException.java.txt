This code defines a custom exception class `FailedDownloadException` that extends `AppException`. It's used to indicate a failed file download attempt, specifically when an audio file isn't found. The exception takes a filename as input and generates an error message in German ("AudioFile [filename] wurde nicht gefunden" meaning "AudioFile [filename] was not found"). This is part of a media store application's error handling system.
