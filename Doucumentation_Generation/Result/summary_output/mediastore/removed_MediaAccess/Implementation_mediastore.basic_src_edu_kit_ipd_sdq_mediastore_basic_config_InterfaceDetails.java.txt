The `InterfaceDetails` class stores configuration details for a business interface in a media store application. It holds references to a business interface (`IBusinessInterface`), a provided interface (`ProvidedInterface`), an EJB component (`EJB`), and a boolean flag indicating if it's local. The class provides getter methods to access these fields. Essentially, it acts as a container for interface-related metadata in the application's configuration. (98 words)
