This code defines a custom exception `FailedUploadException` that extends `AppException`. It's thrown when an audio file fails to upload/save, containing an error message specifying the failed file and wrapping the original cause (`Throwable`). The exception provides a constructor that takes the filename and the underlying exception as parameters.
