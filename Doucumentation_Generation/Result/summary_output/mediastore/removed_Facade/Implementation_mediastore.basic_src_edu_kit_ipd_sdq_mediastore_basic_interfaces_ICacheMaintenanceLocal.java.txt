The code defines a local EJB (Enterprise JavaBean) interface `ICacheMaintenanceLocal` that extends the `ICacheMaintenance` interface. It serves as a local business interface for cache maintenance operations, indicating it's intended for use within the same JVM (Java Virtual Machine). The `@Local` annotation specifies its scope. The interface itself is empty, inheriting all functionality from its parent interface. This is part of a media store system licensed under GPLv3.
