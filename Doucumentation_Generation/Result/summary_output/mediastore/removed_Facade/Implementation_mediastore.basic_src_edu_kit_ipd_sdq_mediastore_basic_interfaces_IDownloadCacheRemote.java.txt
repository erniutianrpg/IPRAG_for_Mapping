This code defines a remote EJB (Enterprise JavaBean) interface `IDownloadCacheRemote` that extends the `IDownloadCache` interface. The `@Remote` annotation indicates it's accessible remotely, allowing clients to invoke its methods across JVMs. The interface itself is empty, inheriting all functionality from `IDownloadCache`, suggesting it serves as a remote access point for download caching operations. The header notes it's part of the Media Store V3 system under GNU GPLv3 license.
