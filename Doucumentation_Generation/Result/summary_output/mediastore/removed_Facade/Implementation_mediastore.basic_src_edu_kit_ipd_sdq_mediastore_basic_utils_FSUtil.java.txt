This code provides file system utilities for a media store application. It handles file operations like creating temporary filenames, writing files (both local and remote content), reading files into memory, converting between byte arrays and file paths, and determining file extensions based on download requests. Key features include writing content to temporary files, reading/deleting files after consumption, and managing both local and remote file content through a unified interface. All operations include proper error handling and directory creation when needed.
