This code manages configuration settings for EJBs (Enterprise Java Beans) loaded from an XML file (`ejbconfig.xml`). It uses XStream to deserialize the XML into a map of `EJB` objects, only reloading if the file's timestamp changes. The `reconfigurable` flag and `getEJBs()` method provide access to the configuration state and loaded EJBs, respectively. The code ensures efficient updates by tracking the file's last modification time.
