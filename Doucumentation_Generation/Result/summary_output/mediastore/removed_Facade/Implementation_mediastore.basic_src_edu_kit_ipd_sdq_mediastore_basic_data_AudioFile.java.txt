The `AudioFile` class represents an audio file with metadata (stored in an `AudioFileInfo` object) and binary content (stored in a `FileContent` object). It provides getters and setters for audio file attributes like ID, album, artist, bitrate, genre, release year, title, and uploader, which are delegated to the contained `AudioFileInfo` object. The class also manages the file's binary content through `getContent()` and `setContent()` methods. It's serializable for network transmission. (98 words)
