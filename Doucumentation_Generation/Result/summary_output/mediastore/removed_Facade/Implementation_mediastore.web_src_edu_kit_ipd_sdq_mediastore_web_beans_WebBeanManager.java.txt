The `WebBeanManager` class provides static methods to initialize required business interfaces (`initRequiredInterface`) and check if an interface is local (`isLocal`). It uses an inner `WebBean` class (extending `BaseEJB`) to delegate these operations. The `WebBean` sets its EJB name to "webbean" and leverages parent class methods to handle interface initialization and locality checks. Essentially, it acts as a facade for accessing EJB functionality. (98 words)
