This code implements a caching mechanism for audio file downloads in a media store system. The `CacheImpl` class acts as a wrapper around a `CacheSingleton`, checking if requested audio files (by ID and bitrate) are cached. If cached, it returns them directly; if not, it fetches them from the underlying `IDownload` service, caches them, and returns them. The cache can also be cleared. It handles file content conversion and supports both local and remote calls. The class is implemented as a stateless EJB with local and remote interfaces.
