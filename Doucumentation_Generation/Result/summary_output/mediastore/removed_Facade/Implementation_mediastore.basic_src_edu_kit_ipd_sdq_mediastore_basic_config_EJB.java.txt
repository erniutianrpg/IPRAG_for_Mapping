The `EJB` class represents an Enterprise Java Bean configuration, storing its name, host, port, application/module/bean names, and mappings of provided/required interfaces. It offers methods to access/modify these attributes, including adding/getting interfaces, and overrides `equals()` for comparison based on all fields. The `toString()` method provides a formatted string representation of the EJB's configuration and interfaces. This class is annotated for XML serialization with XStream.
