This code defines an abstract `AppException` class that extends Java's `Exception` class. It provides three constructors: a default no-arg constructor, one accepting an error message, and another accepting both a message and a cause (Throwable). This serves as a base class for custom exceptions in the Media Store application, following standard exception handling patterns. The class is part of the `edu.kit.ipd.sdq.mediastore.basic.exceptions` package.
