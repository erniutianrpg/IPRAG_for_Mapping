This code implements a singleton EJB cache for `AudioFile` objects using Google's Guava library. It caches audio files keyed by `IdAndBitrate` pairs, tracks cache hits/misses, and calculates hit rates. The cache has a configurable maximum size, provides methods to get/put/clear cached items, and is thread-safe with synchronized counters. It's designed as a singleton bean with bean-managed transactions.
