The `RequiredInterface` class represents a required interface in a media store configuration. It stores the interface name (e.g., "IDownload") and links to a `ProvidedInterface` object. The class provides constructors to initialize these fields, getter methods to access them, and a `toString()` method that formats the data as a readable string with indentation. The `@XStreamAlias` annotation enables XML serialization with the tag "RequiredInterface".
