This code creates a configuration file (`ejbconfig.xml`) for an EJB-based media store application. It defines multiple EJBs (Enterprise Java Beans) with their provided and required interfaces, then serializes this configuration to XML using XStream. Each EJB represents a different component of the system (e.g., audio watermarking, cache, facade) with specific interfaces for communication. The configuration is then loaded back to verify its correctness and printed to console. Essentially, it sets up and validates the inter-component dependencies for a distributed media store system.
