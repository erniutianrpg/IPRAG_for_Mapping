This code defines a local EJB (Enterprise JavaBean) interface `IDownloadCacheLocal` that extends the `IDownloadCache` interface. The `@Local` annotation indicates it's designed for local access within the same JVM. The interface itself is empty, inheriting all functionality from its parent interface, suggesting it's meant to provide local access to download caching capabilities in a media store application. The code is part of a GNU GPL-licensed media store system.
