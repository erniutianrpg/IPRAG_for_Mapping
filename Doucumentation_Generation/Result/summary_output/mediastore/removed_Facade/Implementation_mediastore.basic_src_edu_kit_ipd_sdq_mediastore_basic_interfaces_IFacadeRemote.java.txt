This code defines a remote interface `IFacadeRemote` in the `edu.kit.ipd.sdq.mediastore.basic.interfaces` package, extending the `IFacade` interface. Marked with `@Remote`, it indicates this is an EJB remote interface, allowing clients to access the facade methods remotely. The interface itself is empty, inheriting all functionality from `IFacade`. The header includes licensing information under GNU GPL v3.
