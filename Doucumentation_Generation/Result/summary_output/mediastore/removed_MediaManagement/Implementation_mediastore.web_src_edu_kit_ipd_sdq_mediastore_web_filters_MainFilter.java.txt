This code implements a servlet filter (`MainFilter`) that controls access to web resources based on user authentication. It checks if a user is logged in (via `SessionBean`): 

- Unauthenticated users are redirected to the login page unless accessing login/registration pages.
- Authenticated users are redirected to the main page if trying to access login/registration, or logged out if accessing the logout URL. 
- Static resources (JS, CSS, PNG files) bypass the filter.

The filter enforces proper navigation flow between login, registration, and main application pages. (98 words)
