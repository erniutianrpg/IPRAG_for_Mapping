This Java class `RequiredInterface` represents a required interface in a component-based system. It stores: 
1. A `name` (e.g., "IDownload") 
2. A `providedInterface` that fulfills this requirement 
The class includes a constructor, getter methods, and a `toString()` method for formatted output. It uses XStream annotations for XML serialization, marking the class with `@XStreamAlias("RequiredInterface")`. The class essentially models a dependency relationship between components. (98 words)
