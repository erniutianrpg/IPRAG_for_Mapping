This code defines a remote EJB (Enterprise JavaBean) interface `IDownloadCacheRemote` that extends `IDownloadCache`. The interface is marked with `@Remote`, indicating it's accessible remotely. It's part of a media store system licensed under GPLv3, but contains no methods itself, inheriting all functionality from its parent interface `IDownloadCache`. The purpose is likely to provide remote access to download caching capabilities in a distributed system.
