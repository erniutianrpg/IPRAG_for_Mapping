The `PropertiesUtil` class provides a utility method `initProperties()` that creates and configures Java Properties for connecting to an EJB (Enterprise JavaBean). It takes a `ProvidedInterface` parameter, extracts the host and port from its associated EJB, and sets up properties for JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface) with the correct initial context factory and ORB (Object Request Broker) settings. The returned Properties object is used for establishing remote EJB connections.
