The `LameUtil` class provides functionality for audio file conversion using LAME (an MP3 encoder/decoder). It initializes by copying `lame.exe` to the working directory if missing, then offers `encode()` and `decode()` methods to convert audio files with specified bitrates. The `execLame()` method handles the actual execution of LAME commands. The class ensures proper file handling and error checking during operations.
