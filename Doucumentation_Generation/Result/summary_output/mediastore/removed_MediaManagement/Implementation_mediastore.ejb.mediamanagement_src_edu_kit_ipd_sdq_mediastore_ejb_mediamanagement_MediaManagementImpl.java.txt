This code implements a media management system as a stateless EJB (Enterprise JavaBean). It provides three main functions: uploading audio files (converting them if needed), retrieving a list of audio file metadata, and downloading files (either individually or zipped together for multiple files). The class acts as a middle layer, coordinating with other components (MediaAccess, Download, and Packaging) through interface dependencies. It handles file conversion, packaging, and error checking during these operations. The system is designed to work both locally and remotely, as indicated by the remote/local interface implementations.
