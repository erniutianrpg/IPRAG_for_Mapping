The code defines a local EJB interface `ICacheMaintenanceLocal` that extends the `ICacheMaintenance` interface. It serves as a local (in-process) interface for cache maintenance operations within a media store application, following the EJB specification. The interface is marked with `@Local` annotation, indicating it's designed for local access within the same JVM. The actual functionality would be defined in the parent `ICacheMaintenance` interface. This is part of a larger media store system licensed under GPLv3.
