The `PropertiesException` class is a custom exception that extends `AppException`. It provides two constructors: one that accepts an error message and a cause (another throwable), and another that accepts only an error message. Both constructors delegate to the parent class. This exception is likely used for property-related errors in the application. (50 words)
