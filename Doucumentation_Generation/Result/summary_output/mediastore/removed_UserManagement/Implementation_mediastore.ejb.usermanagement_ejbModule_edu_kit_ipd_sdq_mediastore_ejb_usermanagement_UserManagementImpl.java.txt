This code implements a stateless EJB for user management in a media store application. It provides two main functions: user registration (hashing passwords before storage) and user login (verifying credentials against stored hashes). The class interacts with a database adapter to persist user data and throws exceptions for invalid operations (duplicate users, bad credentials). It extends a base EJB class and implements both local and remote interfaces for user management.
