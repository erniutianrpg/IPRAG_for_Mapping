The `AudioFile` class represents an audio file with metadata and content. It contains an `AudioFileInfo` object for metadata (ID, album, artist, bitrate, genre, etc.) and a `FileContent` object for the audio data. The class provides getters and setters for all metadata fields, which delegate to the underlying `AudioFileInfo` object, as well as methods to access the file content. It's a serializable data transfer object for audio files. (98 words)
