This code defines a `GlobalConstantsContainer` class that manages application configuration properties loaded from a "GlobalConstantsContainer.properties" file. It provides static methods to access specific properties like temporary directory path (`getTempDirPath`), file directory (`getFileDir`), and cache capacity (`getCacheCapacity`). The properties are loaded only once or when the file is modified, using a timestamp check for efficiency. The class handles file I/O operations and property retrieval while managing resources properly.
