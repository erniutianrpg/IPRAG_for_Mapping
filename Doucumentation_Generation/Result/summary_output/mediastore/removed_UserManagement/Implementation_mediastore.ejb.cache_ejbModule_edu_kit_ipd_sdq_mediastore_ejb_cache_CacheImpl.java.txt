This code implements a caching mechanism for audio file downloads in a media store application. The `CacheImpl` class acts as a wrapper around a `CacheSingleton` to provide non-blocking data fetching. It checks if requested audio files (by ID and bitrate) are cached, returns cached files if available, and fetches uncached files from the next service (`IDownload`). Retrieved files are then cached for future requests. The class also provides a method to clear the cache. It supports both local and remote calls and handles file content conversion as needed.
