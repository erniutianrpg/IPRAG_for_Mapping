This code defines an abstract `DbException` class that extends `AppException`, serving as a base for database-related exceptions. It provides three constructors: a default one, one with a custom error message, and one with both a message and a cause (throwable). The class inherits standard exception handling while specializing for database operations. The serialVersionUID ensures serialization compatibility. (98 words)
