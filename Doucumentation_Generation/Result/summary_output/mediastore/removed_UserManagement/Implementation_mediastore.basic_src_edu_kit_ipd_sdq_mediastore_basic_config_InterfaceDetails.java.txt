The `InterfaceDetails` class is a configuration class that stores and provides access to details about a business interface. It holds references to a business interface (`IBusinessInterface`), a provided interface (`ProvidedInterface`), an EJB component (`EJB`), and a boolean flag indicating if it's local. The class offers getter methods to access these fields. Essentially, it acts as a container for interface-related metadata in a media store application. (98 words)
