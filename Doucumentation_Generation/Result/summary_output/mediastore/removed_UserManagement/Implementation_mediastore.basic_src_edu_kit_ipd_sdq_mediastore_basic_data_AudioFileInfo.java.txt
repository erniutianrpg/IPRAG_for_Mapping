The `AudioFileInfo` class is a serializable data transfer object (DTO) that stores metadata about audio files, including ID, album, artist, bitrate, genre, release year, title, and uploader. It provides getters and setters for all fields, a method to generate a filename from artist and title, and a `toString()` method for string representation. This class is used to transfer audio file information between client and database layers without direct database entity dependencies.
