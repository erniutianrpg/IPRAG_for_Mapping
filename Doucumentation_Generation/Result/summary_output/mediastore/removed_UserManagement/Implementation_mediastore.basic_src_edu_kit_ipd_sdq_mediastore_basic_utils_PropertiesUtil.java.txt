The `PropertiesUtil` class provides a utility method `initProperties()` that creates and configures Java Properties for EJB (Enterprise JavaBeans) communication. It takes a `ProvidedInterface` parameter, extracts the host and port from its associated EJB, and sets up properties for JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface) context initialization and CORBA ORB configuration. The returned Properties object is ready for use in establishing remote EJB connections.
