This code defines a custom exception `UserAlreadyExistsException` that extends `DbException`. It is thrown when attempting to create a user with an email that already exists in the database. The exception includes a constructor that takes an email address as input and generates an error message indicating the duplicate user (in German: "existiert schon" meaning "already exists"). The exception is part of a media store system's basic exception handling.
