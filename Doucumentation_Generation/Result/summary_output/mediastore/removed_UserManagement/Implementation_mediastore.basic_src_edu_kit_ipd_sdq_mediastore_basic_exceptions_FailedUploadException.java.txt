This code defines a custom `FailedUploadException` class that extends `AppException`. It represents an error that occurs when audio file uploads fail. The exception includes a descriptive message combining "Fehler beim Speichern des Audios" (German for "Error while saving the audio") with the filename, and wraps the original cause (`Throwable inner`). The class is part of a media store application and is licensed under GPLv3.
