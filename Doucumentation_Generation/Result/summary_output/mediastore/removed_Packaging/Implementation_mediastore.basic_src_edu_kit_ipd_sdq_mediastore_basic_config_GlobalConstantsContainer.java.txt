This code provides a configuration management utility that loads and caches properties from a "GlobalConstantsContainer.properties" file. It offers static methods to access specific properties like temporary directory path, file directory, and cache capacity. The properties are loaded only once or when the file is modified (checked via timestamp), ensuring efficient access. The class handles file I/O operations and property management while providing thread-safe access to configuration values.
