The code defines a local EJB (Enterprise JavaBean) interface `ICacheMaintenanceLocal` that extends another interface `ICacheMaintenance`. This interface is marked with `@Local`, indicating it's designed for local access within the same JVM. The interface itself is empty, inheriting all functionality from its parent interface, suggesting it serves as a local-specific extension point for cache maintenance operations. The accompanying license header indicates it's part of the Media Store V3 project under GPLv3.
