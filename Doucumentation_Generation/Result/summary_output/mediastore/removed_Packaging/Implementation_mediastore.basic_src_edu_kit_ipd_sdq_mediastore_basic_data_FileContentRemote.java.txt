The `FileContentRemote` class extends `FileContent` and represents remote file content. It stores file data as a byte array (`bytes`), provides getter/setter methods for it, and overrides `isLocal()` to return `false`, indicating the content is not stored locally. This class is serializable (as indicated by `serialVersionUID`).
