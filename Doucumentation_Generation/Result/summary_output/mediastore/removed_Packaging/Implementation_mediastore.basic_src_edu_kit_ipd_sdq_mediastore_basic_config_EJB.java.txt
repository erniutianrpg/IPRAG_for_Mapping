The `EJB` class represents an Enterprise Java Bean configuration, storing its name, host, port, application/module/bean names, and interfaces. It maintains maps of provided and required interfaces with methods to add/get them. The class includes getters for all fields, an `equals()` method to compare EJBs by their properties, and a `toString()` method that formats all information as a string. This serves as a configuration container for EJB components in a distributed system. (98 words)
