The `FSUtil` class provides utility methods for file system operations, including: generating temporary filenames, writing files from either local paths or byte arrays, reading files into memory, converting between byte arrays and file paths, and determining file extensions based on download counts. It handles both local and remote file content, creates necessary directories, and includes cleanup methods. The class is part of a media store system and is licensed under GPLv3.
