The `LameUtil` class provides utility methods for working with the LAME MP3 encoder/decoder. It can: 1) Initialize LAME by copying `lame.exe` from resources to the working directory if missing; 2) Encode audio files to MP3 with specified bitrate; and 3) Decode MP3 files to WAV. It handles file operations and process execution, checking for successful conversions via file existence and size. The class supports both Windows and other OSes.
