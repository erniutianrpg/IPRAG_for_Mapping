The `PropertiesUtil` class provides a utility method `initProperties()` that creates and configures Java Properties for EJB (Enterprise JavaBeans) communication. It takes a `ProvidedInterface` parameter, extracts the host and port from its associated EJB, and sets up properties for the JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface) context factory and CORBA ORB (Object Request Broker) with these values. The returned Properties object is configured for remote EJB lookup.
