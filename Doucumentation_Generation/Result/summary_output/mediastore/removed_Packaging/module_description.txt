This module implements a distributed media store system with components for audio file management, user registration, and content delivery. It provides core functionality for storing and retrieving audio files with metadata, packaging files into archives, and caching frequently accessed content. The system follows an EJB-based architecture with clearly defined interfaces for local and remote operations, configuration management, and exception handling. Key features include audio file conversion utilities, session management for web access, and a configurable caching mechanism to optimize performance. The module establishes a foundation for a scalable media storage and distribution platform with proper separation of concerns between business logic, data transfer, and system configuration.
