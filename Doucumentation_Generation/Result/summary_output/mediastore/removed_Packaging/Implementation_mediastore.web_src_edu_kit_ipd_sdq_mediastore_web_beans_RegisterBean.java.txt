The `RegisterBean` is a JSF managed bean that handles user registration. It stores user details (email, first name, last name, password) and provides a `doRegister()` method that validates and submits the data to a backend facade (`IFacade`). On success, it redirects to the login page; on failure (due to naming exceptions or existing users), it shows error messages and stays on the registration page. The bean implements `Serializable` for session persistence.
