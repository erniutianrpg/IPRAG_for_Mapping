This code defines a remote EJB (Enterprise JavaBean) interface `IDownloadCacheRemote` that extends the `IDownloadCache` interface. The `@Remote` annotation indicates it's accessible remotely, allowing clients to invoke its methods across JVMs. The interface itself is empty, inheriting all functionality from `IDownloadCache`, suggesting it serves as a remote access point for whatever download caching operations are defined in the parent interface. The code is part of a media store system licensed under GPLv3.
