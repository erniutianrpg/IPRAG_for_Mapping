This code implements a singleton EJB cache for `AudioFile` objects using Google's Guava library. The cache stores audio files keyed by `IdAndBitrate` pairs, with a configurable maximum size. It tracks cache hits/misses and calculates hit rates. Key methods include `getIfPresent` (retrieves cached files), `put` (stores files), and `clear` (empties cache). The cache is thread-safe with synchronized counters and initialized post-construction.
