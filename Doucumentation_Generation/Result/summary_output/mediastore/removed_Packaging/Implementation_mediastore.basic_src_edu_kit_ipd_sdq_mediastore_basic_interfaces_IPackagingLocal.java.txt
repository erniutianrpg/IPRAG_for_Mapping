This code defines a local EJB (Enterprise JavaBean) interface `IPackagingLocal` that extends another interface `IPackaging`. The `@Local` annotation indicates it's designed for local access within the same JVM. The interface itself is empty, inheriting all functionality from `IPackaging`. It's part of a media store system licensed under GPLv3, serving as a basic packaging component interface.
