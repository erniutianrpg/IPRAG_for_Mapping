This code defines a custom exception class `WavFileException` that extends Java's `Exception` class. It provides four constructors to create exceptions with: no message/cause, a message only, both a message and a cause, or a cause only. This exception is likely used to handle errors related to WAV file operations in an audio watermarking system. The class follows standard exception handling practices with serialization support.
