This code defines a `RegisterBean` class, a managed bean in a Java web application that handles user registration. It stores user details (email, first name, last name, password) and provides a `doRegister()` method that validates and registers a new user via a facade interface. If successful, it redirects to the login page; otherwise, it shows error messages for server issues or existing users. The class follows JavaBean conventions with getters/setters and implements `Serializable`.
