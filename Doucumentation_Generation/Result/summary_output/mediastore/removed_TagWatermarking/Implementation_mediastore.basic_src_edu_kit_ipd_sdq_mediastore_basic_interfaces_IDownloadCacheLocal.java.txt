This code defines a local EJB (Enterprise JavaBean) interface `IDownloadCacheLocal` that extends the `IDownloadCache` interface. The `@Local` annotation indicates it's designed for local access within the same JVM. The interface itself is empty, inheriting all functionality from its parent interface, suggesting it serves as a marker or may be extended with local-specific methods later. It's part of a media store system licensed under GPLv3.
