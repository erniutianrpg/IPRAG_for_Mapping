This code defines a custom `FailedUploadException` class that extends `AppException`. It represents an exception thrown when audio file uploads fail, storing the filename and an inner exception. The constructor creates an error message indicating the failed audio file save operation, combining the filename with a default error text. This exception is part of a media store application's error handling system.
