The `PropertiesException` class is a custom exception that extends `AppException`. It provides two constructors: one that accepts an error message, and another that accepts both a message and a cause (another throwable). This exception is likely used to handle property-related errors in the application. The class includes a serial version UID for serialization compatibility. (60 words)
