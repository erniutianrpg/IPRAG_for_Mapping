This code implements a JSF managed bean (`DownloadBean`) for a media store web application. It handles downloading audio files by: 
1. Retrieving a list of available audio files from a facade interface
2. Allowing users to select multiple files for download
3. Processing selected files into either a single MP3 or a ZIP archive
4. Streams the content to the user via PrimeFaces' StreamedContent
5. Supports different bitrates and handles both local and remote file storage
6. Includes session management and error handling
