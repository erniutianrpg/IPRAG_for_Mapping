This code defines a custom exception class `FailedDownloadException` that extends `AppException`. It's thrown when a file download fails, specifically indicating that an audio file (with the provided filename) wasn't found. The exception message is constructed in German ("AudioFile [filename] wurde nicht gefunden"). The class includes a serial version UID for serialization purposes.
