This code implements a stateless EJB (Enterprise JavaBean) for audio file watermarking. It adds a comment tag to downloaded MP3 files containing the downloader's login information ("[login] has downloaded this file from Mediastore"). The class acts as a middleware between download requests and the actual download service, processing each audio file after download to embed the watermark. It handles both local and remote file operations, writing watermarked files to temporary storage before returning them to the client. The watermark persists in the file's metadata using the JAudiotagger library.
