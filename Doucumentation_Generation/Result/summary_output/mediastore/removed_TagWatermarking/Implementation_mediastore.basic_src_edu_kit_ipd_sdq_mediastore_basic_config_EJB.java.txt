The `EJB` class represents an Enterprise Java Bean configuration, storing its name, host, port, application/module/bean names, and interfaces. It maintains maps of provided and required interfaces with methods to add/get them. The class includes getters for all fields, an `equals()` method for comparison, and a `toString()` method for formatted output. It's annotated with `@XStreamAlias` for XML serialization support. Essentially, it's a configuration container for EJB components with interface management capabilities. (98 words)
