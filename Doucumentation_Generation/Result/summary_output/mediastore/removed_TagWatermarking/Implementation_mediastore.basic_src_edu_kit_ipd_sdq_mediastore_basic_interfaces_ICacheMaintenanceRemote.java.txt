The code defines a remote EJB (Enterprise JavaBean) interface `ICacheMaintenanceRemote` that extends `ICacheMaintenance`. This interface is marked with `@Remote`, indicating it's accessible remotely by clients. The interface itself is empty, inheriting all functionality from its parent interface `ICacheMaintenance`, suggesting it's likely used for cache maintenance operations in a distributed system. The code is part of a media store system released under GNU GPL v3.
