This code manages configuration for EJBs (Enterprise Java Beans) by loading them from an XML file (`ejbconfig.xml`). It uses XStream for XML parsing and checks the file's timestamp to avoid reloading if unchanged. The configuration includes EJB names and their provided/required interfaces. The `reconfigurable` flag indicates if dynamic reloading is allowed. Key methods are `loadConfig()` (loads/updates config) and `getEJBs()` (retrieves EJB map).
