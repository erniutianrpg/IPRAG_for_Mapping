This module implements a comprehensive media store system with EJB-based backend services for audio file management, including user authentication, file upload/download, watermarking, and caching functionality. The core architecture consists of distributed components that handle audio processing (MP3/WAV conversion, metadata tagging, and digital watermarking), user registration/login, and performance optimization through caching. The system provides both local and remote interfaces for its services, with configuration management for EJB deployment and exception handling for various operational scenarios. The web frontend integrates with these services through managed beans that handle user interactions while maintaining session state and file streaming capabilities.
