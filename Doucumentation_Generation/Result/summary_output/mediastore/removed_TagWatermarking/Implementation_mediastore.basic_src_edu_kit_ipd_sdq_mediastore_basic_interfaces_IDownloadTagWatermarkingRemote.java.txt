This code defines a remote EJB (Enterprise JavaBean) interface `IDownloadTagWatermarkingRemote` that extends `IDownloadTagWatermarking`. The `@Remote` annotation indicates it's accessible remotely by clients. The interface itself is empty, inheriting all functionality from its parent interface, suggesting it's meant for remote access to download operations with potential tagging/watermarking features. The license header shows it's part of the Media Store V3 system under GPLv3.
