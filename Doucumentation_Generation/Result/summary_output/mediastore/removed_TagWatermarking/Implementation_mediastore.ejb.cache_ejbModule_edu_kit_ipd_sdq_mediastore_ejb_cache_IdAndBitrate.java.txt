The `IdAndBitrate` class is a simple Java bean that pairs an ID (long) with a bitrate (int). It provides getters/setters for both fields and implements `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods to compare objects based on their ID and bitrate values. The class is serializable, making it suitable for use in distributed systems like EJBs. The hash code is generated by concatenating the ID and bitrate as a string.
