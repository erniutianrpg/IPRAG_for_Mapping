This code handles fetching notifications for users in a system. It checks user authorization (admin, instructor, or student) and retrieves notifications based on the target user type. Admins can get all notifications, while others get filtered active notifications. It also handles marking unread notifications as shown for non-admin users and filters out already read notifications unless fetching all. The response returns notification data in JSON format.
