This code checks the join status of a user (student or instructor) in a course using a registration key. For students, it verifies if they are registered. For instructors, it checks either their account request status (if creating an account) or their registration status. It returns a `JoinStatus` JSON response indicating whether the user has joined the course. The action is accessible to any logged-in user with a valid join link.
