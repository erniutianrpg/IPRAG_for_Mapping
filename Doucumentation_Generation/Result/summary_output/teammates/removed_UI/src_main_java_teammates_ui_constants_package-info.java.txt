This code defines a Java package named `teammates.ui.constants` that serves as a container for all constant values to be shared between the back-end and front-end of the application. The package's purpose is to centralize and provide easy access to shared constants, promoting consistency and reducing duplication across the codebase. The comment indicates these constants are specifically meant for front-end usage.
