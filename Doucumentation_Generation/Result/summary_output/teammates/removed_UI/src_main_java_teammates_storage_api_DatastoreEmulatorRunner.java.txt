This code launches a local Google Cloud Datastore emulator for development/testing purposes. It configures the emulator with a 0.9 consistency level, uses a specified port from configuration, enables disk persistence, and sets a data directory. The emulator starts when the `main` method is executed. This allows running Datastore operations locally without connecting to the actual cloud service.
