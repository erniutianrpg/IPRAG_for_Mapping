The `FeedbackSessionRemindRequest` class represents a request to send reminder emails for a feedback session. It includes the course ID, session name, instructor ID, list of users to remind, and a flag for sending a copy to the instructor. The class validates that required fields (course ID, session name, and non-empty user list) are not null or empty. This request is typically used by instructors to remind students or other instructors about pending feedback submissions.
