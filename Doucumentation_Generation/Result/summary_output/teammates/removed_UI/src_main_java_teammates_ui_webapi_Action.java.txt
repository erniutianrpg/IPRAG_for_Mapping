The `Action` class is an abstract base class for handling HTTP requests in a web API. It provides:
1. Authentication initialization and access control checks
2. Request parameter handling and validation
3. User information management (both registered and unregistered users)
4. Utility methods for common operations
5. Abstraction points for specific actions to implement (minimum auth level, access control, and execution)
6. Integration with various system components (Logic, Email, Tasks, etc.)

Concrete action classes extend this to implement specific API endpoints while inheriting common request handling functionality.
