The `AccountRequestsData` class is an API output wrapper for a list of account requests. It extends `ApiOutput` and contains a list of `AccountRequestData` objects. It provides getter and setter methods to access and modify the list of account requests. The class initializes an empty `ArrayList` for `accountRequests` by default. This serves as a container for transmitting account request data through the API. (72 words)
