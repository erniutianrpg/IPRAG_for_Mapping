The `NotificationsData` class is an API output wrapper that converts a list of `NotificationAttributes` into a list of `NotificationData` objects. It takes `NotificationAttributes` as input, transforms each into `NotificationData` using a stream, and provides a getter method to retrieve the resulting list. This class serves as a data transfer object for notification information in API responses. (60 words)
