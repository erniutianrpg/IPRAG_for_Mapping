The `AuthServlet` is an abstract base class for handling OAuth2 authentication in a Java web application. It provides methods to:  
1. Configure Google OAuth flow with email scope  
2. Generate redirect URIs for OAuth callbacks  
3. Create/delete HTTP cookies for user authentication  
4. Store authentication state (next URL and session ID)  

Key features include cookie management (secure, HTTP-only) and integration with Google's OAuth2 for user email authentication. The servlet serves as a foundation for concrete authentication implementations. (98 words)
