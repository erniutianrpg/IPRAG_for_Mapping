This code defines a `GetInstructorPrivilegeAction` API endpoint that retrieves an instructor's privileges in a course. It checks if the requester is either an admin or a valid instructor for the course. The endpoint accepts a course ID and optional instructor ID/email parameters. It fetches the instructor's privileges and returns them as JSON. Access is restricted to logged-in users with proper course instructor permissions or admin status.
