The `ResetAccountAction` class is an admin-only API endpoint that resets a student's or instructor's Google ID in a specific course. It either resets a student's ID and sends a registration invite, or does the same for an instructor. If the original Google ID is no longer associated with any students or instructors, it deletes the account. The action requires either a student or instructor email and a course ID as parameters, returning a success message upon completion.
