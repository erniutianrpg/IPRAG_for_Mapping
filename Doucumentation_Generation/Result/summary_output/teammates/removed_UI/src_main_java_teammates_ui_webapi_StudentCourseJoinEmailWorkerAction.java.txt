This code is a worker action that sends a course registration email to a student. It retrieves course and student details from the request parameters, checks if they exist, then generates and sends either a join email or a rejoin email (if the student is rejoining after resetting their Google ID). The email is sent via an email sender, and a success message is returned. The action is restricted to admin users only.
