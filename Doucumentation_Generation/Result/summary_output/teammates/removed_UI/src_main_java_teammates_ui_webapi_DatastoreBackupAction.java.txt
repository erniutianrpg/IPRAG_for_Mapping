This code implements a cron job for performing Google Cloud Datastore backups. It checks if backups are enabled and skips if in dev environment or disabled. It authenticates with Google Cloud, constructs a backup request with a timestamped output location in Google Cloud Storage, and executes the backup via Google's Datastore export API. The code logs success/failure responses and returns a JSON result indicating the operation status.
