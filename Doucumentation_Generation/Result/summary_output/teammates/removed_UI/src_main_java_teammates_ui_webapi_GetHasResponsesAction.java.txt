This code checks whether responses exist for feedback sessions or questions in a course. For instructors, it verifies access and checks if there are responses for a specific question or course. For students, it checks if they have submitted responses for a specific session or all sessions in a course. The results are returned as JSON indicating the presence (or absence) of responses. Access control ensures only authorized users (instructors for their courses, students for their sessions) can perform these checks.
