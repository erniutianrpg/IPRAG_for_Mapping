The `ActionFactory` class maps HTTP request URIs and methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to corresponding `Action` classes. It maintains a static mapping of URI-method pairs to action classes during initialization. The `getAction` method uses this mapping to instantiate and return the appropriate `Action` class for a given request URI and method, throwing exceptions for invalid URIs or unsupported methods. This serves as a central router for handling different API endpoints in the application.
