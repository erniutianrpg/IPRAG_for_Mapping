The `OngoingSessionsData` class is an API output format that tracks session statistics. It stores counts of ongoing, open, closed, and awaiting sessions, along with the total number of institutes. It also includes a map of session lists keyed by strings (likely institute names). The class provides getters and setters for all these fields to allow reading and updating the data. This serves as a container for session-related statistics to be returned by an API endpoint.
