This code defines a `GetInstructorAction` API endpoint that retrieves instructor information for a course. It handles three intents: `INSTRUCTOR_SUBMISSION`, `INSTRUCTOR_RESULT`, and `FULL_DETAIL`. For submission/result intents, it verifies the instructor exists in the course. For full detail, it requires user authentication. The endpoint returns instructor data (including Google ID for full detail) or throws errors for unauthorized access or invalid parameters. Access control varies by intent type.
