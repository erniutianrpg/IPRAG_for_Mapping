This code defines a simple API output class `FeedbackSessionSubmittedGiverSet` that represents a set of identifiers for users ("givers") who have submitted feedback in a session. It contains a `Set<String>` of giver identifiers, initialized via constructor, with a getter method to access them. The class serves as a container for this data when returned by an API endpoint.
