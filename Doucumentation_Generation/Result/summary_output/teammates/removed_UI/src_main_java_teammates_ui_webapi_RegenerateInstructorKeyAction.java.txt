This code regenerates an instructor's registration key for a course and resends the course links via email. It handles cases where the instructor doesn't exist, the key regeneration fails, or the email fails to send. The action is admin-only and returns appropriate success/error messages along with the new key or HTTP status codes. The email includes regenerated course join and feedback session links.
