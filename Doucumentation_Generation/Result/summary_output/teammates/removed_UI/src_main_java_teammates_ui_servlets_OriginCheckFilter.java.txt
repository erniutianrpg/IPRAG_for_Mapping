The `OriginCheckFilter` is a servlet filter that validates HTTP request origins to prevent CSRF attacks. It checks: 1) allowed HTTP methods/headers in dev mode, 2) CSRF key or App Engine queue headers for bypassing checks, 3) HTTP referrer validity, and 4) CSRF token presence/validity for POST/PUT/DELETE requests. Invalid requests are denied with a 403 error. The filter ensures requests originate from trusted sources before processing.
