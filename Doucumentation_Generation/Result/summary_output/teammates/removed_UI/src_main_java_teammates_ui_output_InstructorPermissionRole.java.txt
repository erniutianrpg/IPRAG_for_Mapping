This code defines an enum `InstructorPermissionRole` representing different instructor roles (Co-owner, Manager, Observer, Tutor, Custom) in a system. Each role is mapped to a corresponding string value from `Const.InstructorPermissionRoleNames`. The enum provides methods to get the role name and to convert a string to the corresponding enum value, defaulting to Custom for unknown strings. It serves as a type-safe way to handle instructor permissions. (98 words)
