This code defines an API action (`GetFeedbackSessionsAction`) that retrieves feedback sessions based on user type (student/instructor) and optional course ID. It performs access control checks, then fetches and filters sessions accordingly. For students, it returns only visible sessions and hides sensitive information. For instructors, it includes session privileges. The response adapts to whether sessions are in the recycle bin (for instructors) or need student-specific copies. The result is returned as a JSON response containing the filtered session data.
