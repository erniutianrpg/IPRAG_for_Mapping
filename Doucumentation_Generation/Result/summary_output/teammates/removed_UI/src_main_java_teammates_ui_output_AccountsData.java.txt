The `AccountsData` class is an API output wrapper that converts a list of `AccountAttributes` into a list of `AccountData` objects. It serves as a data transfer object (DTO) for account information, transforming the input attributes via a stream operation and providing getter access to the converted list. This enables clean serialization of account data for API responses. (97 words)
