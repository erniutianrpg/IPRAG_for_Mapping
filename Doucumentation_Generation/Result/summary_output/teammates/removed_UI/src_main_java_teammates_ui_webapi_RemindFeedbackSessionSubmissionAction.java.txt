This code defines an API action (`RemindFeedbackSessionSubmissionAction`) that sends reminder emails to specific students about pending feedback submissions. It verifies the instructor's authentication and authorization, checks if the feedback session is open, then queues reminder emails for the specified students. Optionally, it can send a copy to the instructor. The action returns a success message upon completion.
