The `StudentsData` class is an API output wrapper for a list of student records. It converts a list of `StudentAttributes` into a list of `StudentData` objects, which are suitable for API responses. The class provides constructors to initialize an empty list or populate it from `StudentAttributes`, along with getter and setter methods for the student list. Essentially, it serves as a data transfer object for student information in API responses. (94 words)
