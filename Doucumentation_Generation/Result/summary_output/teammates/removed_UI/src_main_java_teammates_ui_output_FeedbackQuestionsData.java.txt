The `FeedbackQuestionsData` class is an API output format that represents a list of feedback questions. It converts a list of `FeedbackQuestionAttributes` into `FeedbackQuestionData` objects and provides methods to access them. Additionally, it includes a method `normalizeQuestionNumber()` to sequentially number the questions (1, 2, 3, etc.). This class serves as a wrapper for feedback question data in API responses.
