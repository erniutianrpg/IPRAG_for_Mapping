The `WebSecurityHeaderFilter` is a servlet filter that adds security headers to HTTP responses. It sets Content-Security-Policy (CSP) with strict resource loading rules, and other security headers like X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, and Strict-Transport-Security. The CSP policy restricts sources for scripts, styles, images, fonts, and other resources, varying slightly between development and production environments. These headers enhance security by preventing XSS, clickjacking, MIME sniffing, and enforcing HTTPS.
