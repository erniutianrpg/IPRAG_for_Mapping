This code defines a REST API action (`RestoreFeedbackSessionAction`) that restores a feedback session from the recycle bin. It verifies the instructor's authentication and permission to modify sessions, checks if the session exists in the recycle bin, restores it, and returns the restored session data with the instructor's privileges. The action throws exceptions if the session doesn't exist or access is unauthorized.
