The `FeedbackQuestionData` class is an API output format for feedback question attributes. It encapsulates question details like ID, number, text, description, type, participant types (giver/recipient), visibility settings, and feedback distribution settings. It converts participant types to visibility types and handles special cases for contribution and constant sum questions. The class also includes a method to hide sensitive information (like question weights) from students. Essentially, it structures feedback question data for API responses while managing visibility and type conversions.
