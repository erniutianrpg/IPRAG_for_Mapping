This code defines a `SearchAccountRequestsAction` class that searches for account requests in a system. As an admin-only action, it takes a search key as input, queries the database for matching account requests, and returns the results as a list of `AccountRequestData` objects wrapped in a `JsonResult`. If the search fails, it returns an error message with the appropriate status code. The output is formatted for API responses.
