The `CourseBasicRequest` class represents a request to modify a course, containing `courseName` and `timeZone` fields. It extends `BasicRequest` and includes validation to ensure neither field is null. Getters and setters are provided for both fields. The class enforces non-null constraints through its `validate()` method, throwing an exception if violated. (85 words)
