The `FeedbackResponseCommentBasicRequest` class handles requests for modifying feedback response comments. It stores the comment text and visibility settings (who can see the comment and the commenter's name). The class validates that the comment text isn't null and provides methods to convert visibility types (`CommentVisibilityType`) to participant types (`FeedbackParticipantType`). Essentially, it encapsulates and processes data for updating feedback comment visibility in a course management system.
