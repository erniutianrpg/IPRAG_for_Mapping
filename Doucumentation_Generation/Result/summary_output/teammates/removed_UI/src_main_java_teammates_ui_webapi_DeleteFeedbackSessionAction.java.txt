This code defines a `DeleteFeedbackSessionAction` class that handles the deletion of a feedback session. It checks if the user is logged in and has permission to modify the session. If authorized, it deletes the specified feedback session from a course using `logic.deleteFeedbackSessionCascade()` and returns a success message. The action requires course ID and session name as parameters.
