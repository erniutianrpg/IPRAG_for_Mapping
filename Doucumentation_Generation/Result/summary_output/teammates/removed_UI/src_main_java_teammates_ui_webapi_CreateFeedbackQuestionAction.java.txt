This code defines a `CreateFeedbackQuestionAction` class that handles the creation of a feedback question in a course. It verifies the instructor's authentication and authorization, validates the request parameters (including question details, giver/recipient visibility, and question structure), and creates the feedback question if valid. The created question is returned as a JSON response. The action ensures only logged-in instructors with modification rights can create questions.
