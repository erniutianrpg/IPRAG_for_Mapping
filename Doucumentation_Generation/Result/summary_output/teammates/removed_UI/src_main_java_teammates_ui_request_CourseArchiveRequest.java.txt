This code defines a `CourseArchiveRequest` class that represents a request to archive or unarchive a course. It contains a boolean `archiveStatus` field to indicate whether to archive (true) or unarchive (false) the course. The class includes getter and setter methods for this field and overrides a `validate()` method (which performs no validation in this case). It extends `BasicRequest`, suggesting it's part of a larger request handling system.
