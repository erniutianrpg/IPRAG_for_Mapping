The `AdminOnlyAction` class is an abstract base class for actions that require administrator privileges. It enforces two rules: 1) users must be logged in (minimum auth level), and 2) throws an `UnauthorizedAccessException` if the user is not an admin. This ensures only admin users can access actions extending this class. (60 words)
