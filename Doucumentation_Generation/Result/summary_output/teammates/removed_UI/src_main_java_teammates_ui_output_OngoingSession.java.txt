The `OngoingSession` class represents an active feedback session with its status, timing, and related details. It constructs an object from `FeedbackSessionAttributes` and `AccountAttributes`, determining the session status (e.g., "Opened", "Closed"), generating an instructor homepage link, and storing timestamps adjusted to the session's timezone. It provides getter methods for session properties like status, start/end times, creator email, course ID, and session name. The status is derived from the session's state (e.g., grace period, published).
