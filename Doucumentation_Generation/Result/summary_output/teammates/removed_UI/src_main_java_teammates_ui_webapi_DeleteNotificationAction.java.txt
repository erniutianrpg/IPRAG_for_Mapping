This code defines a `DeleteNotificationAction` class that handles HTTP requests to delete a notification by its ID. It's restricted to admin users only. The action retrieves the notification ID from the request parameters, uses the business logic layer to delete the corresponding notification, and returns a success message confirming the deletion. The entire functionality is concise and focused on this single operation.
