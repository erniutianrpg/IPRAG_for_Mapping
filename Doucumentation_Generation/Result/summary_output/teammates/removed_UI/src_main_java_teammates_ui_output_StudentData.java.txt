The `StudentData` class is an API output format for student information, converting `StudentAttributes` into a structured response. It includes fields like email, course ID, name, team, and section, with some nullable fields (Google ID, comments, etc.). It provides getters and setters for these fields and has methods to hide sensitive data from students (`hideInformationForStudent`) and add admin-only details (`addAdditionalInformationForAdminSearch`). This class serves as a data transfer object for student-related API responses. (98 words)
