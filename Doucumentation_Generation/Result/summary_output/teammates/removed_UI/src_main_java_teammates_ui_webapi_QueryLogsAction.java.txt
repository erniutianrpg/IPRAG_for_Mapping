This code defines a `QueryLogsAction` class that allows admin/maintainer users to query system logs with various filters (time range, severity, trace ID, etc.). It validates parameters, sets default values (e.g., 24-hour window, INFO severity), constructs a query, processes it through `logsProcessor`, and returns the results. Admin users get additional filtering options and see sensitive data, while maintainers get redacted logs. The response is returned as JSON.
