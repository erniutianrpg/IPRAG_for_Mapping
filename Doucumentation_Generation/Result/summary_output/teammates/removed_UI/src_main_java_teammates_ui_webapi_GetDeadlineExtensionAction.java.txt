This code defines a `GetDeadlineExtensionAction` class that retrieves deadline extension information for a user in a specific course and feedback session. It requires admin-level access and only works in development environments. The action takes course ID, feedback session name, user email, and role (instructor/student) as parameters, fetches the corresponding deadline extension from the database, and returns it as JSON. If no extension is found, it throws an `EntityNotFoundException`.
