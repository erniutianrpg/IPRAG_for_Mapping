This abstract class `BasicCommentSubmissionAction` extends `BasicFeedbackSubmissionAction` and provides common validation methods for feedback response comments in an educational system. It includes methods to:  
1. Validate if a question allows comments on responses  
2. Check if a comment already exists for a response  
3. Verify response ownership for students (both team and individual)  
4. Verify response ownership for instructors  

These methods throw exceptions for invalid operations or unauthorized access. The class serves as a base for actions involving feedback response comments.
