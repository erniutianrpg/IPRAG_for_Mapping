This code defines an API action to unpublish a feedback session in a course. It checks if the requesting instructor has permission to modify the session. If the session is published, it unpublishes it and schedules an email notification if enabled. The action returns the updated session data or an error if the session doesn't exist or parameters are invalid. Requires logged-in access.
