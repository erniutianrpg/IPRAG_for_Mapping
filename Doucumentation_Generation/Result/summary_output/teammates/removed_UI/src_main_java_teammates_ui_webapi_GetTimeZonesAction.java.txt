This code defines a `GetTimeZonesAction` API endpoint that returns supported time zones and their UTC offsets. It's accessible only to admin/maintainer users. The action retrieves all available time zone IDs (excluding "SystemV" ones), calculates their current UTC offsets in seconds, and returns them along with the time zone database version in a structured JSON response. The output is sorted alphabetically by time zone ID using a `TreeMap`.
