The `FeedbackResponsesData` class is an API output wrapper for a list of feedback responses. It converts a list of `FeedbackResponseAttributes` into a list of `FeedbackResponseData` objects for API output. It provides constructors to initialize with either a list of responses or an empty list, along with getter and setter methods for the responses. This class serves as a data transfer object for feedback response data in API responses. (94 words)
