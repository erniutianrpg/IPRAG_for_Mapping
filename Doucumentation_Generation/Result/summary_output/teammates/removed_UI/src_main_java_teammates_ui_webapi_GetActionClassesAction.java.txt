This code defines a `GetActionClassesAction` class that retrieves a list of action class names. It requires users to be logged in as either Maintainers or Admins. When executed, it collects all action class names from `ActionFactory.ACTION_MAPPINGS`, converts them to simple class names, and returns them as a JSON response wrapped in an `ActionClasses` object. Essentially, it's an API endpoint that provides metadata about available actions to authorized users.
