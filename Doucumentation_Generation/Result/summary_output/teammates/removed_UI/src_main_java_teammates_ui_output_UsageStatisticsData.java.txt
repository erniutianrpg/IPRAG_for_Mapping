The `UsageStatisticsData` class is an API output format that encapsulates usage statistics for a system. It extends `ApiOutput` and includes fields like start time, time period, and counts for responses, courses, students, instructors, account requests, emails, and submissions. The constructor takes a `UsageStatisticsAttributes` object and maps its data to the output fields. Getters are provided for all fields to access the statistics. This class serves as a data transfer object for usage statistics in API responses.
