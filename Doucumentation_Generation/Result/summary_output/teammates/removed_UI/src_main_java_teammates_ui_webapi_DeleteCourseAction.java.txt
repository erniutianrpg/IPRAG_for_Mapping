This code defines a `DeleteCourseAction` class that handles deleting a course in an educational system. It requires the user to be a logged-in instructor with modification privileges. The action verifies access control, deletes the specified course (and its associated data) using `logic.deleteCourseCascade()`, and returns a success message ("OK"). The course ID is obtained from the request parameters.
