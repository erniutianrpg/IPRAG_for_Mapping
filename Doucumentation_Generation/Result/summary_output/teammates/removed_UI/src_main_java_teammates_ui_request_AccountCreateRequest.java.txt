The `AccountCreateRequest` class handles the creation of a new instructor account. It stores and validates three fields: instructor's email, name, and institution. The validation checks for null values and ensures each field meets specific format requirements (valid email, proper name format, valid institution name). If any validation fails, it throws an `InvalidHttpRequestBodyException` with the corresponding error messages. The class provides getter and setter methods for each field.
