This code defines an API action (`GetSessionResponseStatsAction`) that retrieves and returns the response statistics (actual vs. expected submissions) for a feedback session in a course. It checks if the requester is an admin or an authorized instructor, then fetches the session data and calculates the submission counts. The result is returned as a JSON object containing the stats. Access is restricted to logged-in users with proper permissions.
