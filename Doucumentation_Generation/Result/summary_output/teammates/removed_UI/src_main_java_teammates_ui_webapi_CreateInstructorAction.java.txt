This code adds a new instructor to an existing course. It verifies the requester's admin/instructor privileges, sanitizes input data, and creates an instructor with specified attributes (name, email, role, visibility). The instructor is then registered, invited via email, and indexed for search. It handles errors like duplicate instructors or invalid parameters. The endpoint requires logged-in access and proper course modification permissions.
