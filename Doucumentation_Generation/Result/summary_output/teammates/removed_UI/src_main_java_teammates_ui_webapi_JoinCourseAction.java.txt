This code handles course joining for students and instructors via a web API. It verifies the user's registration key and entity type (student/instructor), then processes the join request. For students, it enrolls them in the course; for instructors, it adds them as course instructors. It handles exceptions like invalid parameters or existing/non-existent entities. Upon success, it sends a confirmation email and returns a success message. The action is accessible to any logged-in user with a valid join link.
