This code defines a `GetFeedbackQuestionsAction` class that handles API requests to retrieve feedback questions for a session. It checks access control based on the requester's role (student/instructor) and intent (submission/result viewing). Depending on the intent, it fetches relevant questions, populates necessary fields, filters moderated questions if needed, and hides sensitive information for students. The response includes normalized question numbers and question data tailored to the requester's access level.
