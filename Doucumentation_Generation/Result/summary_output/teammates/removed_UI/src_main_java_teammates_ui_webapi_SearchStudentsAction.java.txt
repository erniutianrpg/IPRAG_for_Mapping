The `SearchStudentsAction` class handles searching for students in a system. It allows only logged-in instructors or admins to search. Instructors can search students within their courses, while admins can search across the entire system. The action takes a search key and entity type as input, returns matching students as `StudentData` objects, and includes additional admin-specific details if requested. Results are returned as JSON. Unauthorized access or invalid parameters trigger appropriate error responses.
