This code defines a `Course` entity class for object persistence using Objectify. It stores course details including ID, name, creation/deletion timestamps, timezone, and institute. The class provides constructors (including a required no-arg one for Objectify) and getter/setter methods. Default values are set for timezone (if null) and creation timestamp (current time if null). The entity is annotated for Google Cloud Datastore with `@Entity` and `@Index` for indexing.
