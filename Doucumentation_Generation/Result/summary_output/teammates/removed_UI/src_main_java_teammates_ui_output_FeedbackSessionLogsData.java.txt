This code defines a class `FeedbackSessionLogsData` that structures logs for feedback sessions in a course. It takes grouped log entries, student data, and session details as input, then processes them into a list of `FeedbackSessionLogData` objects. Each object contains logs for a specific feedback session along with relevant student and session information. The class provides a method to retrieve these processed logs. Essentially, it organizes raw log data into a structured output format for API responses. (98 words)
