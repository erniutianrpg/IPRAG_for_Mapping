This code defines an API action to retrieve recipients for a feedback question in an educational platform. It handles both student and instructor intents, verifying access rights for each. For students, it checks if they can answer the question and submits feedback; for instructors, it does similarly. The action returns a list of recipients (students or instructors) who can receive feedback for the specified question, packaged in a `FeedbackQuestionRecipientsData` response. Access control ensures only authorized users can view recipients.
