The `CourseSectionNamesData` class is a simple API output wrapper that holds a list of course section names (as strings). It extends `ApiOutput` and provides a constructor to initialize the list and a getter method (`getSectionNames()`) to retrieve the list. This class serves as a data transfer object for returning section names in API responses. (50 words)
