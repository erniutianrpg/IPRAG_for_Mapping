This code defines a `CreateNotificationAction` class that handles creating new notification banners. It accepts a request with notification details (start/end times, style, target user, title, message), validates the data, generates a unique ID, and attempts to create the notification. If successful, it returns the new notification data; otherwise, it returns appropriate error responses for invalid parameters or unexpected conflicts (though conflicts are unlikely due to UUID usage). This is an admin-only action.
