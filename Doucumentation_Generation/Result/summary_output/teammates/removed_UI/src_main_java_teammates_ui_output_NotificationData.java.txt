The `NotificationData` class is an API output format that represents a notification. It encapsulates notification attributes like ID, timestamps (start, end, creation), style, target user, title, message, and visibility status (`shown`). The class provides a constructor to initialize these fields from a `NotificationAttributes` object and includes getter methods to access each attribute. Essentially, it serves as a data transfer object for notification information in API responses. (98 words)
