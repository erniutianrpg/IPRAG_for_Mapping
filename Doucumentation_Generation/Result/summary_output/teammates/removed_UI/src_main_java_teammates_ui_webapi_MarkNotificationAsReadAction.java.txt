This code defines a `MarkNotificationAsReadAction` class that handles marking a notification as read for a user. It verifies the user is logged in, processes a request containing the notification ID and timestamp, updates the read status via a logic layer, and returns the updated list of read notifications. Errors are handled for invalid parameters or non-existent entities. The endpoint is accessible to any authenticated user.
