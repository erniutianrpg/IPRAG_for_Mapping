The `ActionClasses` class is a simple API output wrapper that stores and provides a list of action class names (as strings). It extends `ApiOutput` and has a constructor to initialize the list, along with a getter method to retrieve it. This class serves as a container for transmitting a collection of action class identifiers through an API response. (50 words)
