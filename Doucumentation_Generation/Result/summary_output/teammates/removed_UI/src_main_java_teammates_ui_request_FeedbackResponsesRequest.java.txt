This code defines a request structure for submitting feedback responses in a system. The main `FeedbackResponsesRequest` class contains a list of `FeedbackResponseRequest` objects, each representing an individual response with a recipient and response details. The main class provides methods to get/set responses and extract recipient lists, while the inner class validates that recipients and response details aren't empty/null. Overall, it handles the data transfer and basic validation for batch feedback response submissions. (98 words)
