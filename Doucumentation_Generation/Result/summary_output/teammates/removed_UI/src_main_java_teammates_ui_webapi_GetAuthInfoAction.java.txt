This code handles authentication information requests in a web application. It checks if a user is logged in: if not, it generates login URLs for different user roles (student, instructor, admin, maintainer) with optional redirect URLs. If logged in, it returns user info. It also manages CSRF token security by checking/creating a cookie. The endpoint is publicly accessible and doesn't perform actual login/logout operations. The response includes either login URLs or user details along with CSRF protection.
