The `FeedbackSessionLogEntryData` class represents a student's log entry for a feedback session. It stores student data (as `StudentData`), the log type (e.g., access or submission), and a timestamp. The constructor converts a `FeedbackSessionLogEntry` and `StudentAttributes` into these fields. Getters provide access to the student data, log type, and timestamp. Essentially, it's a data transfer object for feedback session logs. (94 words)
