This code defines a `SearchInstructorsAction` class that searches for instructors across the entire system. It takes a search key as input, queries the database for matching instructors, and returns their details (including additional admin information like keys, institute, and Google ID) in a structured JSON format. If the search fails, it returns an error message with the appropriate status code. The action is restricted to admin users only.
