The `RegkeyValidityData` class is an API output format that indicates the status of a registration key. It provides three boolean fields: `isValid` (whether the key is valid), `isUsed` (whether the key has been used), and `isAllowedAccess` (whether the requester can access it). The class includes getter methods for each field to check the key's validity, usage status, and access permission. (98 words)
