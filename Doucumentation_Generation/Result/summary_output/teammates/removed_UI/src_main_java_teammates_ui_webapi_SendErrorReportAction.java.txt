The `SendErrorReportAction` class handles sending error reports to system admins. It allows public access (no authentication required) and accepts an error report request. The report, containing user info (or "Non-logged in user"), request ID, subject, and content, is logged as a severe error, which triggers an email notification to admins. The response confirms successful submission.
