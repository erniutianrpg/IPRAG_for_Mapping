This code handles an API request to retrieve all feedback responses given by a user (student or instructor) for a specific feedback question. It checks access control based on the user's role (student or instructor) and intent, then fetches the responses from the database. For MCQ and MSQ questions, it also includes participant comments if available. The responses are formatted and returned as JSON. The endpoint is publicly accessible but enforces proper authorization checks.
