The `FeedbackQuestionBasicRequest` class represents a request to modify a feedback question in a system. It contains fields for question details (number, brief, description, type), participant types (giver/recipient), feedback visibility settings, and entity count settings. The class validates these fields, converts visibility types to participant types, and handles special cases for certain question types. It provides getters and setters for all fields, ensuring proper data encapsulation and type conversion between JSON and Java objects.
