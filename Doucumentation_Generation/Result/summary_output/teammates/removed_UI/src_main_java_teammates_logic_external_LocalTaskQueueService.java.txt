The `LocalTaskQueueService` class simulates a task queue service for a local development environment. When `addDeferredTask` is called, it either skips execution (if task queues are inactive) or immediately sends an HTTP POST request to the specified worker URL with the task's parameters and request body. The request mimics Google App Engine task queue headers (`X-AppEngine-QueueName`) and bypasses admin checks for local testing. The `createBasicUri` helper method constructs the request URL with query parameters. Errors during execution are logged.
