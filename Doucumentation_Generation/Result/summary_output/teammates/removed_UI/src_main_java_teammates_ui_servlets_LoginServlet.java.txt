The `LoginServlet` handles user authentication by redirecting to appropriate login pages based on the server configuration. For development servers, it redirects to a dev login page. If the user already has a valid authentication cookie, it redirects to the requested URL (`nextUrl`). Otherwise, it either redirects to a Firebase login page (if configured) or to Google's OAuth sign-in page, passing along the original request URL for post-login redirection. The servlet also sanitizes URLs to prevent HTTP response splitting attacks.
