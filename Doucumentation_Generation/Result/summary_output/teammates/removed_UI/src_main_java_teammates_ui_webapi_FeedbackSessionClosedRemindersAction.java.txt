This code is a cron job that sends reminder emails for recently closed feedback sessions. It fetches sessions closed in the past hour, generates closed-session emails for each, queues them for sending, and marks them as sent in the database. If errors occur during email scheduling, they're logged. The action returns "Successful" upon completion. It's an admin-only operation.
