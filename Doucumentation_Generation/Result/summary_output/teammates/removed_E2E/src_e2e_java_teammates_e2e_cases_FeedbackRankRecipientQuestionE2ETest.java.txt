This code is an end-to-end (E2E) test for Rank Recipient-type feedback questions in an educational platform. It verifies: 
1) Instructor functionality to add, copy, and edit Rank Recipient questions on the feedback edit page.
2) Student functionality to submit and edit responses to these questions on the submission page. 
3) Database persistence of questions and responses. The test uses TestNG and page objects to simulate user interactions and validate outcomes.
