This code tests the instructor course join confirmation page functionality in an end-to-end (E2E) test scenario. It verifies: 
1. Handling of invalid join links with appropriate error messages
2. Successful course joining with valid keys 
3. Redirection to home page if already joined
4. Account creation and joining for new instructors
5. Proper behavior when reusing registration keys

The test uses both invalid and valid registration keys to validate different join scenarios for instructors, checking page responses and user redirections.
