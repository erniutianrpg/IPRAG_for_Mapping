This code defines a `SearchInstructorsAction` class that searches for instructors across the system. It takes a search key as input, queries the database for matching instructors, and returns their details (including additional admin information like keys, institute, and Google ID) in JSON format. If the search fails, it returns an error message with the appropriate status code. The action is restricted to admin users only.
