This code defines a `AdminHomePage` class for automated testing of an admin interface that manages instructors. It provides methods to:
1. Add instructors individually (with separate fields or single-line input)
2. Add all queued instructors at once
3. Retrieve status messages for instructors
4. Handle registered instructor accounts (view details and reset account requests)
5. Verify page content

The class uses Selenium WebDriver for browser automation, with element locators and helper methods for form filling, clicking, and waiting for elements.
