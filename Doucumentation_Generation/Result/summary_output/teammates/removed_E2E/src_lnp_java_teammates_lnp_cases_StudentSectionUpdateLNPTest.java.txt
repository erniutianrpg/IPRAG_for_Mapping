This code is a load and performance (LNP) test case for updating student sections in bulk via an API. It simulates multiple instructors updating a student's section from "Section 1" to "Section 2" while handling 500 feedback responses. The test checks if the system maintains an error rate below 1% and a mean response time under 10 seconds under load. It uses JMeter for test execution, generates test data (courses, instructors, students, feedback), and includes setup/teardown methods for test isolation.
