This code is an end-to-end (E2E) test for numerical scale feedback questions in an educational platform. It tests:  
1. **Edit Page**: Verifies, adds, copies, and edits numerical scale questions, checking their details and database persistence.  
2. **Submit Page**: Tests submitting, verifying, and editing numerical scale responses, ensuring they're saved correctly.  

The test uses prepared test data and validates both instructor (question management) and student (response submission) functionalities.
