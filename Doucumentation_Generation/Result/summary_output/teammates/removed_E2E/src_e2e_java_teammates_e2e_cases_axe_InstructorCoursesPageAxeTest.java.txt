This code is an accessibility test for an instructor courses page in a web application. It uses the Axe-core library to analyze the page for accessibility violations. The test logs in as an instructor, loads the courses page URL, runs an accessibility check, and asserts that no violations are found. The test data is prepared from a JSON file before execution. The main goal is to ensure the page meets accessibility standards. (98 words)
