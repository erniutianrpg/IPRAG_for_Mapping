This E2E test verifies whether system error emails are correctly sent to admins for different exceptions. It tests seven exception types (AssertionError, NullPointerException, DeadlineExceededException, DatastoreException, UnauthorizedAccessException, InvalidHttpParameterException, EntityNotFoundException) by triggering each via backend requests. For critical errors (first four), it expects email notifications, while for handled exceptions (last three), it verifies no emails are sent. The test doesn't require browser interaction or test data preparation.
