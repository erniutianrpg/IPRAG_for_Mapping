The `StudentCourseDetailsPage` class is a Page Object Model for a student's course details page in an automated test suite. It verifies various course-related details including:

1. Course information (name, ID, institute)
2. Instructor details (names, emails)
3. Student's personal information (name, section, team, email)
4. Teammates' details (names, emails) with sorting capability

The class contains methods to validate these elements against expected values from test data, using Selenium WebElement interactions and assertions. It also includes a helper method to sort teammates by name.
