The `ResetAccountAction` class resets a student's or instructor's Google ID associated with their account in a specific course. It checks if either a student or instructor email is provided, verifies their existence, resets their Google ID, and schedules a registration invite. If the old Google ID is no longer associated with any accounts, it deletes the account cascade. Returns a success message upon completion. This action is restricted to admin users only.
