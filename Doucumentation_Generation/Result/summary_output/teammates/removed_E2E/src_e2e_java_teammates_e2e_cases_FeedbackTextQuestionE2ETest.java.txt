This code is an end-to-end test for text-based feedback questions in an educational platform. It verifies functionality on both the instructor's feedback editing page and the student's submission page. The test checks: 
1) Question loading, adding, copying, and editing by instructors
2) Student response submission, verification, and editing
3) Database persistence of questions and responses
The test uses prepared test data and validates UI interactions match expected behavior and database states.
