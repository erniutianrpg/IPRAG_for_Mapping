This code defines an abstract `AppPage` class that serves as a base for page objects in Selenium-based end-to-end testing. It provides common functionality for interacting with web pages, including:

1. Page initialization and validation
2. Element interactions (clicking, filling forms, selecting dropdowns)
3. Waiting mechanisms (visibility, clickability, staleness)
4. Modal and toast message handling
5. Table verification
6. Date picker and rich text editor support
7. Browser window management
8. Retry mechanisms for flaky tests

The class follows the Page Object pattern, encapsulating page-specific behaviors and elements to make tests more maintainable. It includes utility methods for common test operations and handles various UI components consistently across different page types.
