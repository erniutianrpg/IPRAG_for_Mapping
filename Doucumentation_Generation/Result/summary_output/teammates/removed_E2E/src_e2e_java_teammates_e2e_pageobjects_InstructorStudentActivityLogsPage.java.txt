This code defines a page object class `InstructorStudentActivityLogsPage` for testing an instructor's view of student activity logs in a web application. It provides methods to interact with UI elements like dropdowns (activity type, student name, session), date/time pickers, and search functionality. The class can set search filters, initiate searches, and check if logs exist for specific sessions. It also handles date/time conversions for filtering and verifies page content. Essentially, it encapsulates all interactions with the student activity logs page for automated testing.
