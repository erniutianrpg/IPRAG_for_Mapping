This code is a worker action that indexes an instructor for search functionality. It takes a course ID and instructor email as input, retrieves the instructor's details, and attempts to index them. If indexing fails with a `SearchServiceException`, it returns a 502 status to trigger an automatic retry. On success, it returns a success message. The action is restricted to admin users only.
