The `LNPResultsStatistics` class stores and displays Load & Performance (L&P) test metrics including error percentage, mean/90th percentile response times, throughput, error count, and sample count. It provides getters for mean response time and error percentage, and a `displayLnpResultsStatistics()` method that formats these metrics into a readable string (e.g., throughput, average response time) and logs them via TestNG's Reporter. The formatted output presents the statistics concisely in a single line.
