This code defines an API endpoint `GetCourseSectionNamesAction` that retrieves section names for a specific course. It requires user authentication and verifies that the requesting instructor has access to the course. If authorized, it fetches and returns the section names for the given course ID. If the course doesn't exist, it throws an `EntityNotFoundException`. The response is wrapped in a `CourseSectionNamesData` object.
