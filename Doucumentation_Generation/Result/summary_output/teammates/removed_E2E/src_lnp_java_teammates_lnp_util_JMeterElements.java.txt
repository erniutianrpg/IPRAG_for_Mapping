This code is a utility class for creating JMeter test elements programmatically. It provides methods to configure various JMeter components like Test Plans, Thread Groups, HTTP Request samplers, CSV data sources, cookie managers, and controllers. The class helps automate the setup of load and performance (L&P) tests by generating JMeter elements with predefined configurations, including HTTP requests, headers, CSRF token extraction, and data-driven testing using CSV files.
