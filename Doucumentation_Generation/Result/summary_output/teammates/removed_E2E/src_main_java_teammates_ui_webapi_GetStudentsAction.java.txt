This code defines a `GetStudentsAction` API endpoint that retrieves student lists based on different access levels. Instructors can view all students in a course or specific sections they have privileges for, while students can only view their own team members. The endpoint checks authorization, verifies permissions, and returns appropriate student data, hiding sensitive information for student requests.
