This code is an accessibility test for an instructor home page in a web application. It uses the Axe library to analyze the page for accessibility violations after logging in as an instructor. The test checks if the page is free of accessibility issues (WCAG violations) and reports any violations found. The test data is loaded from a JSON file, and the page is accessed via a specific URL. The test passes only if no accessibility violations are detected.
