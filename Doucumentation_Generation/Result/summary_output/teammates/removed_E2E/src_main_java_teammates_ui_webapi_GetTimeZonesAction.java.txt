This code defines a `GetTimeZonesAction` API endpoint that returns supported time zones and their UTC offsets. It's accessible only to maintainers or admins. The action retrieves the current time zone rules version, collects all available time zone IDs (excluding "SystemV" ones), calculates their UTC offsets in seconds for the current time, and returns them in a sorted map along with the time zone version. The output is wrapped in a `TimeZonesData` JSON response.
