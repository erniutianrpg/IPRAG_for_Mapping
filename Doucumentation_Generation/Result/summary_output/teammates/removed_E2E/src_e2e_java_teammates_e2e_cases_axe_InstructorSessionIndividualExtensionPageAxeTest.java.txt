This code is an accessibility test for an instructor's session individual extension page in a web application. It uses Axe-core to check for WCAG violations. The test:

1. Loads test data from a JSON file
2. Navigates to the instructor's session extension page
3. Logs in as an instructor
4. Analyzes the page for accessibility violations using Axe
5. Asserts that no violations are found

The test ensures the page meets accessibility standards, with any violations reported in a formatted output.
