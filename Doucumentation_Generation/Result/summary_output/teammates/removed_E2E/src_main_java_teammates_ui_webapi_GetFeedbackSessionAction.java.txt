This code defines a `GetFeedbackSessionAction` API endpoint that retrieves feedback session data for different user roles (student or instructor) and intents (submission, result, or full details). It checks access control based on the user's role and intent, then returns appropriate feedback session data with role-specific information hidden as needed. The endpoint supports five intents: student submission/result, instructor submission/result, and full details (for instructors with view permissions).
