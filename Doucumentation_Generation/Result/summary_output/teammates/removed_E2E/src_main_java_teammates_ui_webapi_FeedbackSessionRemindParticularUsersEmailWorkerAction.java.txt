This code is a worker action that sends reminder emails for feedback sessions to specific students and instructors in a course. It processes a request containing the session details, target users, and whether to notify the requesting instructor. It retrieves the relevant student and instructor data, generates reminder emails, and queues them for sending. If errors occur during email generation or sending, it logs them and returns a success message regardless.
