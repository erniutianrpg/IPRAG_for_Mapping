This code is an end-to-end test for an admin sessions page in a feedback system. It verifies the display and filtering of feedback sessions with different time statuses (open, awaiting, future). The test prepares test data with relative timings (3 days ago, tomorrow, future dates), logs in as admin, and checks if sessions are correctly displayed based on their time status. It also tests session filtering functionality by date range, ensuring only relevant sessions are shown. The test validates both session visibility and correct time formatting in the UI.
