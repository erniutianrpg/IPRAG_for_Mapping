This code is a load and performance (LNP) test case for a course update API in an educational platform. It simulates multiple instructors updating a course (with 500 feedback sessions) using JMeter, measuring error rates and response times. The test verifies if the system maintains acceptable performance (error rate <1%, mean response time <10s) under load. It includes setup for test data generation, HTTP request configuration, and cleanup.
