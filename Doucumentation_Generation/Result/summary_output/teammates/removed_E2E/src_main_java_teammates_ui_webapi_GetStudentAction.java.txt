This code defines a `GetStudentAction` API endpoint that retrieves a student's information from a course. It handles three access scenarios: 
1) Instructors accessing a student's data (requires permission verification)
2) Unregistered students accessing via registration key
3) Registered students accessing their own data

The endpoint performs authorization checks, retrieves the student data, and returns it in a `StudentData` object, hiding sensitive information for non-instructors. Admins get additional details like Google ID and registration key.
