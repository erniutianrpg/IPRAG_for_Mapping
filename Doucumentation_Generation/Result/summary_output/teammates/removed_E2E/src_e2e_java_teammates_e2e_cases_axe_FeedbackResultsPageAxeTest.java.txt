This code is an accessibility test for a feedback results page in a web application. It uses the Axe library to analyze the page for accessibility violations. The test:

1. Loads test data from a JSON file
2. Navigates to the student feedback results page for a specific course and session
3. Logs in as a test student ("Alice")
4. Runs Axe accessibility checks on the page
5. Asserts that no accessibility violations are found

The test ensures the feedback results page meets accessibility standards.
