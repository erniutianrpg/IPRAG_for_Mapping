The `LNPSpecification` class defines and verifies Load and Performance (LNP) test criteria. It sets thresholds for maximum allowable error rate and mean response time (in seconds). The class uses a builder pattern for configuration and provides methods to check if test results (error percentage and response time) exceed these thresholds. If they do, it compiles an error message and throws an `AssertionError`. The verification is done via `verifyLnpTestSuccess()`, which checks both metrics against the specified limits.
