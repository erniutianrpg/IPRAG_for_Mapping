This code is an end-to-end test for a student notifications page. It verifies that:
1. Only active notifications for the correct user are displayed
2. Notifications can be marked as read, updating the database
3. Read notifications are properly displayed in the UI
4. The notification banner is hidden as expected
The test uses prepared test data and cleans up after execution by deleting test notifications. It extends a base test case class for common functionality.
