This Java code defines a Page Object Model (POM) class `InstructorStudentRecordsPage` for testing an instructor's view of student records in a web application. It:

1. Checks if the page contains expected content (`'s Records`)
2. Verifies the page displays the correct student name and course ID in the header
3. Provides a method to validate student details by comparing them with a `StudentAttributes` object

The class uses Selenium WebDriver for web element interaction and JUnit for assertions.
