This code is a load and performance (LNP) test for an instructor viewing feedback session results in a course management system. It simulates 500 user accounts, creates test data including courses, feedback sessions, questions, and responses, then uses JMeter to test the system's performance under load. The test checks if error rates stay below 1% and mean response times remain under 7 seconds while instructors view session results, including loading questions, sections, and student responses.
