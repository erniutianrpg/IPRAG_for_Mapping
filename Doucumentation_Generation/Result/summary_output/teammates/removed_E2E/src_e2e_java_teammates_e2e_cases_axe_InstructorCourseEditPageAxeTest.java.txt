This code is an accessibility test for an instructor course edit page in a web application. It uses the Axe library to analyze the page for accessibility violations. The test:  
1. Loads test data from a JSON file  
2. Accesses the course edit page as an instructor  
3. Scans the page using Axe  
4. Asserts there are no accessibility violations  
The test ensures the page meets accessibility standards (WCAG) for users with disabilities.
