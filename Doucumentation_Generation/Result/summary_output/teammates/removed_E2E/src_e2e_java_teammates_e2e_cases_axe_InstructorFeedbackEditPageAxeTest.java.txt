This code is an accessibility test for an instructor feedback edit page in a web application. It uses the Axe library to analyze the page for accessibility violations. The test logs in as an instructor, navigates to the feedback edit page, and checks for WCAG violations using Axe. If any accessibility issues are found, the test fails and reports the violations. The test data is loaded from a JSON file before execution. The main goal is to ensure the page meets accessibility standards. (98 words)
