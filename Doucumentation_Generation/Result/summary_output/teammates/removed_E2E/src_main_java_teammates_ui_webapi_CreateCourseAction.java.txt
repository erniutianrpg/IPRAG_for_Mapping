This code defines a `CreateCourseAction` class that handles creating a new course for an instructor. It checks if the user is an authorized instructor at the specified institution, validates the course details (including timezone), and creates the course. If the course ID already exists or parameters are invalid, it throws appropriate exceptions. Upon success, it returns the new course's data and schedules the instructor for search indexing.
