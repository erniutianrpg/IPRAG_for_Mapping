This code is an end-to-end (E2E) test for Rubric-type feedback questions in an educational platform. It verifies: 

1. **Instructor Edit Page**: Tests adding, copying, and editing rubric questions with choices, descriptions, and weights.
2. **Student Submit Page**: Tests submitting, verifying, and editing rubric responses with specific answer selections.

The test ensures proper functionality of rubric question creation, modification, response submission, and persistence in the database. It uses TestNG for testing and verifies UI interactions match backend data.
