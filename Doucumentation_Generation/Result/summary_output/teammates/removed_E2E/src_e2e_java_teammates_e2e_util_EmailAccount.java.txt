The `EmailAccount` class provides access to a real Gmail inbox for testing purposes. It authenticates a user via Google ID, checks for unread emails from a specified sender, and verifies if an email with a given subject exists within the last minute. It can also mark emails as read. The class uses the Gmail API to interact with the inbox, handling authentication retries and converting raw email data into readable format.
