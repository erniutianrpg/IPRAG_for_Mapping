This code is an abstract base class for generating test data in a load and performance (L&P) testing framework. It provides methods to create empty maps for various entity types (accounts, courses, instructors, etc.) and combines them into a JSON DataBundle. It also defines abstract methods for generating CSV headers and data, which concrete subclasses must implement to specify the actual test data structure and content for JMeter L&P tests. The class serves as a template for creating performance test data sets.
