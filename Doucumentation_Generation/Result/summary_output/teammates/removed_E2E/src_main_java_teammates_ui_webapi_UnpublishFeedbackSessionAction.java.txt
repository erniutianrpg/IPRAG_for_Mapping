This code defines an API action to unpublish a feedback session in a course management system. It verifies the instructor's authorization, checks if the session is already unpublished, and if not, unpublishes it. If email notifications were enabled for the session, it queues an unpublish notification email. The action returns the updated session data or appropriate error messages if the operation fails.
