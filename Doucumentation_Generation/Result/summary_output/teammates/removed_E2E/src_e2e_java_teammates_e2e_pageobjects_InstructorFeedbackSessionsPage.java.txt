This code defines the `InstructorFeedbackSessionsPage` class, a Page Object for testing instructor feedback session management in a web application. It provides methods to:

1. Verify session tables and details
2. Add, copy, and delete feedback sessions
3. Manage session visibility, emails, and reminders
4. Publish/unpublish results
5. Handle soft-deleted sessions (restore/delete)
6. Sort and filter sessions

The class interacts with UI elements like tables, dropdowns, and buttons to simulate instructor actions and validate session data. It supports comprehensive testing of feedback session workflows.
