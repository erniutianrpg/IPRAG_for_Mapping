This code is an abstract base class for end-to-end browser tests related to feedback questions in an educational platform. It provides common functionality for:

1. Testing instructor feedback editing pages (`testEditPage()`)
2. Testing student feedback submission pages (`testSubmitPage()`)
3. Helper methods to log in and access these pages (`loginToFeedbackEditPage()`, `loginToFeedbackSubmitPage()`, `getFeedbackSubmitPage()`)

The class sets up test data (instructor, course, feedback session, student) and focuses on UI-intensive operations, separating them from faster operations like viewing results.
