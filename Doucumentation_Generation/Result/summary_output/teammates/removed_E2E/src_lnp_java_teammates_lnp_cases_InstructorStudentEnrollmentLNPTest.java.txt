This code is a load and performance (LNP) test for an instructor's student enrollment API endpoint. It simulates 10 instructors each enrolling 100 students (divided into sections of 25) into courses, using JMeter for load testing. The test verifies the system can handle this load with an error rate below 1% and mean response time under 80ms. It includes setup for test data generation, HTTP request configuration, and cleanup after testing.
