This code defines a Page Object Model for a course join confirmation page in a testing framework. It includes methods to:
1. Verify the joining user's Google ID matches expected
2. Confirm course joining and navigate to a new page
3. Verify displayed confirmation messages
4. Check basic page contents (though this is minimally implemented)

The class interacts with web elements like a confirmation button and uses Selenium for browser automation in end-to-end tests.
