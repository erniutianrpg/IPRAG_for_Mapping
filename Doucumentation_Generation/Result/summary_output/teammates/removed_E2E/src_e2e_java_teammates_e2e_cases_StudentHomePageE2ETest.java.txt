This code is an end-to-end test for a student home page in an educational platform. It verifies that:  
1. Courses visible to a specific student are correctly displayed.  
2. Feedback sessions for each course are shown.  
3. A notification banner is visible.  
The test uses prepared test data, logs in as a student, and checks the page content against expected results.
