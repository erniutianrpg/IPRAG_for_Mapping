This code is an end-to-end test for an instructor's courses page in a web application. It verifies various functionalities including: loading and displaying active/archived/deleted courses, adding new courses, copying courses with sessions, archiving/unarchiving courses, moving courses to recycle bin, restoring courses, and permanent deletion. The test also checks course statistics and permission-based modifications. It uses TestNG for testing and includes setup/cleanup operations via a backdoor API.
