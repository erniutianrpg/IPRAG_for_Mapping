This code defines a `AdminSessionsPage` class for automated testing of an admin sessions page. It provides methods to:
1. Verify session rows match expected data
2. Toggle session filters
3. Set filter start/end dates with timezone handling
4. Apply filters and wait for results
5. Check table timezone
The class uses Selenium WebDriver for browser interactions and assertions to validate session visibility and content against expected values.
