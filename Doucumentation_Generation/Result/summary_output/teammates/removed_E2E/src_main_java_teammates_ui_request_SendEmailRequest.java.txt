The `SendEmailRequest` class represents a request to send an email. It contains an `EmailWrapper` object and validates that all essential email fields (content, recipient, sender, reply-to, and subject) are non-null before processing. The class extends `BasicRequest` and overrides the `validate()` method to ensure the email data is complete and valid.
