The `StudentHomePage` class is a Page Object Model for a student home page in a testing framework. It provides methods to:
1. Verify the page title is "Student Home"
2. Check visibility of course names and feedback sessions for students
3. Close notification banners
4. Mark notifications as read
It uses Selenium WebDriver to interact with and assert web elements like course panels, tables, and buttons. The class extends a base `AppPage` for common functionality.
