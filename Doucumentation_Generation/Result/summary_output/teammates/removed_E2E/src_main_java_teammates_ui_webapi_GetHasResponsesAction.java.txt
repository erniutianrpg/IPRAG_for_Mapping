This code checks whether responses exist for feedback sessions or questions in a course management system. For instructors, it verifies access and checks for responses to specific questions or entire courses. For students, it checks if they've submitted responses for specific or all feedback sessions in a course. The results are returned as JSON indicating whether responses exist. Access control ensures only authorized users (instructors for their courses, students for their sessions) can check responses.
