This code is an end-to-end test for Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) functionality in a feedback system. It verifies:
1. Instructor actions: loading, adding, copying, and editing MCQ questions on the feedback edit page
2. Student actions: viewing, submitting, and editing MCQ responses on the submission page
3. Database persistence for both questions and responses
The test uses prepared test data and checks UI interactions match expected behavior and database states.
