This code is an end-to-end (E2E) test for an instructor's view of student details in a course management system. It verifies that:  
1. The instructor can access and view correct details of a student (Jose) from a test data bundle.  
2. The same functionality works for another student (Benny).  
The test logs in as an instructor, navigates to the student details page, and checks if the displayed information matches the test data. The URL is dynamically generated with course ID and student email.
