This code defines a Page Object Model for a feedback results page in an e2e testing framework. It provides methods to:
1. Verify feedback session details (course ID, name, institute, session name, timings)
2. Validate question details and responses for different question types (MCQ, MSQ, Rubric, etc.)
3. Check visibility of responses and comments based on permissions
4. Verify statistical data for numerical and rubric questions
5. Handle anonymous responses and comments
6. Navigate and interact with various page elements

The class encapsulates all UI interactions and assertions needed to test feedback session results functionality.
