This code is an accessibility test for an instructor's course student details page in a web application. It uses the Axe library to check for WCAG violations. The test:

1. Loads test data from a JSON file
2. Navigates to the student details page as an instructor
3. Analyzes the page for accessibility violations using Axe
4. Asserts that no violations are found

The test ensures the page meets accessibility standards for users with disabilities. It's part of an end-to-end testing suite for the application.
