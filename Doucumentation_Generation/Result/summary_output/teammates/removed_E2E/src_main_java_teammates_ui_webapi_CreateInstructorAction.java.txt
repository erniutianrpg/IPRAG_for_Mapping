This code adds a new instructor to an existing course. It checks if the requester has admin or instructor privileges, validates the request data, sanitizes inputs, and creates the instructor with specified attributes (name, email, role, visibility, etc.). It then schedules tasks like sending an invite and updating search indexes. The operation fails if the email already exists or parameters are invalid. Returns the created instructor's data on success.
