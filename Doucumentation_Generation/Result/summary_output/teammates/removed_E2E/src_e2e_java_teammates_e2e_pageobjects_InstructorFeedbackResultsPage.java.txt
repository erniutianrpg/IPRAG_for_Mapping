This code defines the `InstructorFeedbackResultsPage` class, which represents the feedback session results page for instructors in a testing environment. Key functionalities include:

- Verifying session details and response data
- Publishing/unpublishing results
- Downloading results
- Filtering responses by section/team
- Viewing responses in different formats (question view, giver-recipient-question view, etc.)
- Verifying statistics and comments
- Handling no-response panels
- Supporting various question types (MCQ, rubric, etc.)

The class contains methods to interact with UI elements, validate displayed data against expected values, and navigate different viewing modes for feedback results. It serves as a page object for automated testing of instructor feedback results functionality.
