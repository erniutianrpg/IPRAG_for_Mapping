The `LogoutServlet` handles user logout by: 
1. Invalidating the current session
2. Adding a cookie to invalidate login
3. Redirecting to the home page (`/web`) or a specified frontend URL. 
It extends `AuthServlet` and uses a GET request to perform these actions, returning a 302 (temporarily moved) status.
