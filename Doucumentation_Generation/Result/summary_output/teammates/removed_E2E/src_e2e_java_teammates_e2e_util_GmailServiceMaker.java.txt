The `GmailServiceMaker` class facilitates OAuth 2.0 authentication with the Gmail API. It loads client secrets from a JSON file, builds an authorization flow with read and modify scopes, and manages credential storage. The class can optionally force fresh credentials. It returns an authorized `Gmail` service instance for API interactions, handling token generation either via stored credentials or a local server for new authorization. The implementation uses Google's Java client libraries for secure transport and JSON processing.
