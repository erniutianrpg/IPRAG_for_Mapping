This code is a base class for end-to-end (E2E) browser tests in the Teammates project. It provides common setup/teardown methods, browser management, test data preparation, URL creation, authentication helpers (login/logout), file verification utilities, and backdoor access to test data. The class abstracts core E2E testing functionality like page navigation, email verification, and test data management, allowing specific test cases to focus on actual test logic while reusing these foundational operations.
