This code is an accessibility test for an instructor's student list page in a web application. It uses the Axe library to analyze the page for accessibility violations. The test logs in as an instructor, loads the student list page, and checks for accessibility issues using Axe. If any violations are found, it formats and reports them, asserting that the page should be free of accessibility violations. The test data is loaded from a JSON file before execution.
