The `GetRegkeyValidityAction` class checks if a provided registration key is valid for a logged-in user without authenticating them. It verifies the key's validity for either a student or instructor based on the specified intent (e.g., submission or result). The key is valid if it matches an unregistered student/instructor or if the logged-in user's ID matches the key's registered Google ID. The response indicates whether the key is valid, used, and accessible. This action is publicly accessible.
