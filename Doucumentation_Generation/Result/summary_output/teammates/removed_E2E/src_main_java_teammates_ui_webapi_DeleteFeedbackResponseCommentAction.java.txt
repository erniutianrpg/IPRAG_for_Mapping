This code handles the deletion of feedback response comments in a system (likely an educational platform). It performs access control checks based on the user's role (student or instructor) and intent (submission or result viewing). For students, it verifies session access and comment ownership. For instructors, it checks permissions to modify comments. After validation, it deletes the comment via `logic.deleteFeedbackResponseComment()` and returns a success message. The action ensures only authorized users can delete comments they own or have permission to modify.
