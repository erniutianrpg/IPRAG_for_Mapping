The `AuthServlet` abstract class provides common authentication functionality for servlets, including: 

1. Setting up OAuth 2.0 authorization flow with Google using email scope  
2. Generating redirect URIs for OAuth callbacks  
3. Creating and invalidating login cookies with user info  
4. Managing authentication state (next URL and session ID) during OAuth flow  

It serves as a base class for handling Google OAuth-based authentication in a web application.
