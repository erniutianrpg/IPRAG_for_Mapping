This code is a base class for load and performance (L&P) test cases in a Java application. It provides functionality to:
1. Generate test data in JSON and CSV formats
2. Execute JMeter performance tests
3. Collect and analyze test results
4. Clean up test artifacts
5. Verify performance against specifications
6. Handle test data persistence and deletion

Key features include JMeter test plan execution, result statistics generation, and test data/file management with timestamp-based naming to prevent conflicts.
