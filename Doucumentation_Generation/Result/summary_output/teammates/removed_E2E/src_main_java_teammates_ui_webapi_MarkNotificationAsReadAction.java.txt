This code defines a `MarkNotificationAsReadAction` class that handles marking a notification as read for a user. It requires the user to be logged in (no specific access control). The action takes a request with a notification ID and timestamp, updates the user's read notifications via the logic layer, and returns the list of read notifications. It handles exceptions like non-existent entities or invalid parameters by converting them to appropriate HTTP responses.
