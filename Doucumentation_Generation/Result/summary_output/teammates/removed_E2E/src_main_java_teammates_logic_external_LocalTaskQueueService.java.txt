The `LocalTaskQueueService` class simulates a task queue service for a local development environment. When `addDeferredTask` is called, it either skips execution (if task queues are inactive) or immediately sends an HTTP POST request to the specified worker URL with task parameters and optional request body. The request includes headers to mimic Google App Engine's task queue behavior. The `createBasicUri` helper method constructs the request URL with query parameters. This provides local testing functionality without requiring a real task queue service.
