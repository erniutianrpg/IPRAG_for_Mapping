This code is an end-to-end test for a student course join confirmation page. It verifies two scenarios:  
1. An invalid join link shows an error message.  
2. A valid join link allows the student to confirm and join the course, redirecting to the home page.  
It also checks that already-joined students are redirected directly to the home page. The test uses prepared test data and simulates user interactions through a web page.
