This code defines a `GetFeedbackResponsesAction` API endpoint that retrieves all feedback responses given by a user (student or instructor) for a specific question. It checks access control based on the user's role (student/instructor) and intent, then fetches the responses from the database. For MCQ/MSQ questions, it also includes participant comments if available. The responses are returned as a structured JSON output. The endpoint requires authentication but is accessible to all users (PUBLIC auth level).
