This Java class `InstructorCourseStudentDetailsViewPage` represents a page object for an instructor's view of student details in a course. It verifies displayed student information (name, course ID, section, team, email, comments) matches expected values from `StudentAttributes`. If a field is empty, it checks for a "Not Specified" label. The class includes methods to confirm the correct page is loaded and to validate all student details against provided data. It extends `AppPage` for common browser functionality.
