This code defines a page object class `InstructorCourseDetailsPage` for testing an instructor's course details page in a web application. It provides methods to:
1. Verify course, instructor, and student details
2. Manage students (send invites, remind to join, delete, sort)
3. Download student lists
4. Navigate to student details/edit pages
5. View all student records
The class interacts with web elements using Selenium and contains assertions to validate expected behaviors during testing.
