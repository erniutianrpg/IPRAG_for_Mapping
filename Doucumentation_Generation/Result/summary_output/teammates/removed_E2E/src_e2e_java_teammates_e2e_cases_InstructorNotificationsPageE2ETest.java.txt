This code is an end-to-end test for an instructor's notifications page. It verifies that:
1. Only active notifications for the correct user are displayed
2. Notifications can be marked as read (updating the database)
3. The notification banner visibility is correct
4. Expired or irrelevant notifications are hidden

The test uses prepared test data, checks notification visibility and read status, and cleans up by deleting test notifications after execution.
