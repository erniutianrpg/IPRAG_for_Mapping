This code is an end-to-end test for a notification banner functionality in a student portal. It verifies that:
1. Active notifications display correctly on the student home page
2. The banner can be closed (temporarily hidden until page refresh)
3. Notifications can be marked as read (permanently hidden)
4. Read status is properly stored in the database
The test uses test data from a JSON file and cleans up after execution by deleting test notifications.
