This code is an accessibility test for an instructor notifications page in a web application. It uses the Axe-core library to analyze the page for accessibility violations. The test:

1. Loads test data from a JSON file
2. Logs in as an instructor and navigates to the notifications page
3. Runs Axe accessibility checks on the page
4. Asserts there are no violations
5. Cleans up by deleting test notifications after execution

The test ensures the notifications page meets accessibility standards (WCAG) for users with disabilities.
