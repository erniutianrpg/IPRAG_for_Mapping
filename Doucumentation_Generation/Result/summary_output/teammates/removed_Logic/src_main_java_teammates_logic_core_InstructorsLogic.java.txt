The `InstructorsLogic` class manages instructor-related operations in a system, likely for an educational platform. It handles creating, updating, and deleting instructors, along with associated data like feedback responses, comments, and deadline extensions. Key functionalities include:

- CRUD operations for instructors (create, read, update, delete)
- Managing instructor privileges and visibility to students
- Cascading updates/deletes for related entities when instructor data changes
- Searching for instructors (admin-only)
- Validating instructor roles and permissions
- Regenerating registration keys
- Archiving/unarchiving instructors

The class acts as a middle layer between storage (InstructorsDb) and higher-level application logic.
