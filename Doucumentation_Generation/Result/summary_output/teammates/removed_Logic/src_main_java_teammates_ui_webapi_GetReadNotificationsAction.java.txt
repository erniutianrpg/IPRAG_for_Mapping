This code defines a `GetReadNotificationsAction` class that handles an API request to fetch read notifications for a logged-in user. It checks that the user is authenticated, allows any logged-in user to access their own notifications, retrieves the read notification IDs from the database using the user's ID, and returns them as JSON output. The class enforces no special access controls beyond requiring authentication.
