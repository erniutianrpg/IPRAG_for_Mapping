This code implements a Google reCAPTCHA verification service. It checks user responses by sending them to Google's verification API (`VERIFY_URL`) with a secret key. The `isVerificationSuccessful` method validates the response token and secret key, sends a request to Google's API, parses the JSON response, and returns `true` only if Google's response indicates success (`success: true`). It handles errors by logging them and returns `false` for any failures. The class acts as a wrapper for Google's reCAPTCHA verification API.
