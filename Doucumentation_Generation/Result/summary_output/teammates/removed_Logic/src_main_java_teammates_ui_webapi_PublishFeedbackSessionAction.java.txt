This code defines an API action to publish a feedback session in a course. It verifies the instructor's access rights, checks if the session is already published, and if not, publishes it. If email notifications are enabled, it schedules publication emails. The action returns the published session data or appropriate error responses if the session doesn't exist or parameters are invalid. Requires logged-in user with instructor-level permissions.
