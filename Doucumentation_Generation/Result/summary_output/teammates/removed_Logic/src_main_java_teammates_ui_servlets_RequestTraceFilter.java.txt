This servlet filter handles HTTP request tracing and security headers. It generates or extracts trace/span IDs for request tracking, sets security headers (HSTS, cache control), and enforces request timeouts (60s for user requests, 595s for App Engine tasks). During maintenance, it returns a 503 error. It also validates request parameters as UTF-8 and handles bad requests with 400 errors. The filter ensures proper request tracing via `RequestTracer` initialization before passing requests down the chain.
