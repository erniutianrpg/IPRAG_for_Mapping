The `ErrorReportRequest` class represents a request to create an error report to be emailed to an admin. It contains three fields: `content`, `subject`, and `requestId`, with getter methods for each. The `validate()` method ensures none of these fields are null, throwing an exception if they are. This class extends `BasicRequest`, inheriting basic request functionality. (94 words)
