The `DeadlineExtensionsLogic` class manages operations related to deadline extensions, including creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving extensions. It handles cases like updating email addresses, resetting email flags when deadlines change, and fetching extensions needing closing emails. All operations delegate to a database layer (`DeadlineExtensionsDb`) and include validation checks. The class follows a singleton pattern and throws exceptions for invalid operations or missing entities.
