This code is a Facade class that provides a centralized interface for various business logic operations in a system (likely an educational platform). It delegates functionality to specialized logic classes for different entities like accounts, courses, instructors, students, feedback sessions, questions, responses, comments, notifications, and deadline extensions. Key operations include CRUD operations for these entities, session management, search functionalities, and data validation. The class serves as a single entry point to the system's business logic, simplifying interaction for clients.
