The `LogsProcessor` class handles log operations in a Teammates application. It uses either a local or Google Cloud logging service based on the environment (dev/prod). Key functionalities include: querying logs with parameters, creating feedback session logs, retrieving filtered feedback session logs, and counting logs for specific events within a time range. The class follows a singleton pattern and abstracts the underlying logging service implementation.
