This code initializes and provides Firebase Admin Auth services. It initializes FirebaseApp using credentials from a JSON file and offers a method `generateLoginLink` to create email-based login links for users with a specified continue URL. Errors during initialization or link generation are logged and handled appropriately. The class serves as a wrapper for Firebase authentication functionalities.
