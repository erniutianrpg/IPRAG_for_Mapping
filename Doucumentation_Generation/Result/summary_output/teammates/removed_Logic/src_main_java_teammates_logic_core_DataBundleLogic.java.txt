The `DataBundleLogic` class handles operations related to data bundles in a team management system. It provides functionality to:

1. Persist data bundles to the database, including accounts, courses, instructors, students, feedback sessions/questions/responses/comments, and notifications.
2. Create searchable documents for entities.
3. Remove data bundles from the database.
4. Process and validate instructor privileges, student sections, and feedback questions.
5. Inject real IDs into feedback responses and comments after creation.

The class acts as a central manager for database operations on various entities, ensuring data integrity and proper relationships between entities. It uses multiple database access objects (Db classes) to interact with different entity types.
