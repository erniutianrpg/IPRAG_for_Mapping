This code implements an email sender service using SendGrid API. It converts an `EmailWrapper` object into a SendGrid `Mail` object with sender, recipient, subject, and content (both plain text and HTML versions). The `sendEmail` method sends the email via SendGrid's API, returning the status code and response body, or throws an `EmailSendingException` if the request fails. It handles basic email fields and optional BCC recipients.
