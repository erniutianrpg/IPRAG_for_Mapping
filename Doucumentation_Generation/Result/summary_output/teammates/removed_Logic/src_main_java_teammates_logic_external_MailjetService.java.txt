The `MailjetService` class implements an email sender service using Mailjet's API. It converts an `EmailWrapper` into a `MailjetRequest` with sender, recipient, subject, and content details (both HTML and plain text). The `sendEmail` method sends the request via Mailjet's client, returning the status or throwing an `EmailSendingException` on failure. It uses API keys from configuration for authentication.
