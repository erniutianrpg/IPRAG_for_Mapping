This code defines an API action (`RestoreFeedbackSessionAction`) that restores a feedback session from the recycle bin. It checks if the requesting instructor has modification privileges, verifies the session exists in the bin, restores it, and returns the restored session data with the instructor's privileges. The action requires the user to be logged in and authorized.
