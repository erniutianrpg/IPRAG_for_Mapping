The `LoginServlet` handles user login by redirecting to appropriate authentication flows. For development servers, it redirects to a dev login page. For production, it checks for valid authentication cookies - if valid, redirects to the requested URL (`nextUrl`); if not, redirects to either a Firebase web login (when using Firebase) or Google OAuth sign-in page. The servlet prevents HTTP response splitting and properly encodes redirect URLs. It maintains security by validating cookies and session states.
