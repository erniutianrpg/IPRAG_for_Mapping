The `AccountsLogic` class manages account-related operations in a system (likely an educational platform). It handles creating accounts, retrieving account details, joining courses as students/instructors, deleting accounts (with cascading effects), and managing read notifications. Key functionalities include validating join requests, updating account attributes, and ensuring data consistency when accounts are modified or deleted. The class interacts with other logic components (Courses, Instructors, Students) and uses a database layer (`AccountsDb`) for persistence.
