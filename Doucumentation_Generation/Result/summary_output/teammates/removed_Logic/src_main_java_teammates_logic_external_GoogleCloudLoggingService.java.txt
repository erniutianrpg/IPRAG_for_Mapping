This code provides functionality for interacting with Google Cloud Logging. It allows querying logs with various filters (time range, severity, trace ID, etc.), converts log entries into a standardized format, and retrieves feedback session logs. The main methods include `queryLogs()` for general log queries and `getFeedbackSessionLogs()` for specific feedback session audit logs. It handles pagination, severity conversion, and log entry processing while abstracting Google Cloud Logging API details.
