The `EmailGenerator` class is responsible for generating various types of emails related to feedback sessions, course enrollment, and system notifications in a TEAMMATES application. Key functionalities include:

1. **Feedback Session Emails**: Generates emails for session openings, closings, reminders, and publishing results (e.g., `generateFeedbackSessionOpeningEmails`, `generateFeedbackSessionPublishedEmails`).

2. **Deadline Extension Emails**: Handles emails for deadline extensions (granted, updated, revoked) for students/instructors (e.g., `generateDeadlineGrantedEmails`).

3. **Course Enrollment Emails**: Creates join/re-join emails for students and instructors (e.g., `generateStudentCourseJoinEmail`, `generateInstructorCourseJoinEmail`).

4. **Logs and Recovery Emails**: Compiles error logs and generates session link recovery emails (e.g., `generateCompiledLogsEmail`, `generateSessionLinksRecoveryEmailForStudent`).

5. **Template Handling**: Uses predefined templates to populate email content dynamically with course/session details, deadlines, and personalized links.

The class ensures emails are properly formatted, sanitized, and addressed to the correct recipients based on the context (e.g., students, instructors, or admins).
