This code creates a feedback session log for auditing purposes. It accepts parameters like log type, course ID, session name, and student email, validates the log type, and records the event. The endpoint is publicly accessible with no specific access controls. It skips rigorous validations for performance and logs the event for both local testing and production. The action returns a success message upon completion.
