This code manages feedback questions in a system, handling operations like creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion. Key functionalities include:

1. Creating and updating feedback questions while maintaining consistent question numbering
2. Retrieving questions filtered by session, course, or participant type (instructors/students)
3. Managing question recipients based on participant types and permissions
4. Populating dynamic fields in questions (like MCQ/MSQ options)
5. Cascading updates/deletes to maintain data integrity when questions are modified or removed
6. Validating question consistency and handling related exceptions

The class serves as a logic layer between storage and higher-level components for feedback question operations.
