This code is a worker action that indexes a student for search functionality in a system. It takes a course ID and student email as input, retrieves the corresponding student data, and attempts to index it. If indexing fails (throws SearchServiceException), it returns a 502 error to trigger an automatic retry. On success, it returns a success message. The action is restricted to admin users only.
