This code defines a `SearchAccountRequestsAction` class that handles searching for account requests in a system. It takes a search key as input, queries the database for matching account requests, and returns the results as JSON. If the search fails, it returns an error message. The results are converted from `AccountRequestAttributes` to `AccountRequestData` objects before being wrapped in an `AccountRequestsData` response. This is an admin-only action. (98 words)
