This code creates a new instructor account with sample demo courses. It validates the registration key, sets a default timezone if needed, and checks if the account request exists and hasn't been used. It then imports demo data (courses, sessions) for the instructor, generates a unique course ID based on the instructor's email, and updates the account request status. Finally, it schedules search indexing for students and instructors in the demo course. The code handles various edge cases like duplicate course IDs and invalid parameters.
