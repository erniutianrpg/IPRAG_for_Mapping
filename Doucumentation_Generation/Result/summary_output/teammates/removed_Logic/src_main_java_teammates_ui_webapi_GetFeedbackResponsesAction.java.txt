This code defines a `GetFeedbackResponsesAction` API endpoint that retrieves all feedback responses submitted by a user (student or instructor) for a specific question. It checks access permissions based on the user's role (student/instructor) and intent, then fetches the responses. For MCQ/MSQ questions, it also includes participant comments if available. The responses are returned as a structured `FeedbackResponsesData` object. The endpoint requires authentication but is publicly accessible (minimum auth level: PUBLIC).
