This module serves as the core backend system for an educational platform (TEAMMATES), providing comprehensive functionality for course management, feedback sessions, user authentication, and administrative operations. It handles instructor and student interactions through a web API, including feedback submission and analysis, course enrollment, and notification management. The system integrates with external services for email delivery, authentication (Firebase), logging (Google Cloud), and task queuing, while maintaining security through CSRF protection and request validation. The architecture follows a layered design with clear separation between business logic, API endpoints, and external service integrations, supporting both production and development environments with appropriate service implementations.
