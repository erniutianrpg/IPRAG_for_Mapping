This code handles operations related to feedback responses in a course management system. Key functionalities include:

1. **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete feedback responses with validation checks.
2. **Visibility Control**: Determine which responses are visible to users (students/instructors) based on participant types and permissions.
3. **Session Results**: Generate feedback session results bundles with proper visibility filtering for different user roles.
4. **Team/Section Handling**: Update responses when students change teams/sections or get deleted.
5. **Comment Management**: Cascade operations to associated feedback response comments.
6. **Consistency Checks**: Maintain response consistency for ranking questions after student deletions.

The logic integrates with other components like questions, comments, students, and instructors to manage feedback response data throughout its lifecycle.
