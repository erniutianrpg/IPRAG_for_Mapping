The `AuthProxy` class provides authentication services, choosing between `FirebaseAuthService` (for production) or `EmptyAuthService` (for development) based on configuration flags. It acts as a singleton, offering methods to generate login links and check if email login is enabled. The implementation depends on whether the system is configured to use Firebase authentication or developer server login mode.
