This code implements a local logging service for testing purposes in a Java application. It provides:

1. In-memory storage for feedback session logs and general logs loaded from a JSON file
2. Log querying functionality with filtering by various parameters (severity, timestamp, trace ID, etc.)
3. Feedback session log creation and retrieval
4. Support for different log types (request logs, exception logs) with specific filtering
5. Pagination for log queries with a fixed page size of 10 entries

The service simulates log retention locally without requiring external logging infrastructure, primarily for development/testing environments.
