The `RecaptchaVerifier` class handles reCAPTCHA verification. It uses `GoogleRecaptchaService` in production with a secret key, and `EmptyRecaptchaService` (which likely bypasses verification) in development. The singleton instance verifies user responses via `isVerificationSuccessful()`, which delegates to the appropriate service. This provides a flexible way to toggle between real and mock CAPTCHA verification based on the environment. (98 words)
