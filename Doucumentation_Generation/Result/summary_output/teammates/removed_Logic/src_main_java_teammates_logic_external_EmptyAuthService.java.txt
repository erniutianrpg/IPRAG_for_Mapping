The `EmptyAuthService` class is a stub implementation of an authentication service that performs no actual authentication. It implements the `AuthService` interface but returns an empty string for the `generateLoginLink` method, regardless of input parameters. This serves as a placeholder or null object pattern for scenarios where authentication is not required or should be bypassed.
