This code defines a `GetStudentsAction` API endpoint that retrieves student lists based on the requester's role. Instructors can view all students in a course or specific sections they have permission for, while students can only view their own team members. The endpoint checks authorization, verifies permissions, and returns filtered student data accordingly, hiding sensitive information for student requests.
