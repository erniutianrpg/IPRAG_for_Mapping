The `LocalTaskQueueService` class simulates a task queue service for a local development environment. When `addDeferredTask` is called, it either skips execution (if task queues are inactive) or immediately sends an HTTP POST request to the specified worker URL with task parameters and headers. The request mimics Google App Engine task queue behavior but bypasses the actual queue system, executing tasks directly. Error handling logs any HTTP request failures. The `createBasicUri` helper method constructs the request URL with query parameters.
