This code defines a Java package named `teammates.storage.entity` that contains classes representing persistable entities (data objects that can be stored in a database). The package serves as a container for entity classes that are typically used with object-relational mapping (ORM) frameworks to interact with a database. The brief documentation indicates these classes model data that needs to be persisted.
