The `Action` class is an abstract base class for handling HTTP requests in a web API. It provides common functionality for authentication, authorization, request parameter handling, and request body processing. Key features include:

1. Initializes user authentication info (admin, masquerade, or public access)
2. Validates user access control levels
3. Handles request parameters (strings, booleans, longs)
4. Processes request bodies (JSON deserialization and validation)
5. Provides helper methods for unregistered students/instructors
6. Defines abstract methods for specific action implementations to handle custom authorization and execution

The class serves as a foundation for concrete action implementations to perform specific tasks while handling common web request concerns.
