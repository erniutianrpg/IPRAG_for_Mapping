The `EmptyEmailService` class is a mock email sender service that implements `EmailSenderService` but doesn't actually send emails. It has two methods: `parseToEmail` which simply returns the input email wrapper unchanged, and `sendEmail` which returns a successful status code (200 OK) without performing any email sending operations. This class serves as a no-operation implementation for testing or when email functionality needs to be disabled.
