The provided code snippet defines a Java package named `teammates.logic.external` which is intended to contain logic related to external dependencies and services. This suggests it serves as a separation layer for code that interacts with external systems, APIs, or services, keeping this functionality distinct from the core application logic. The package's purpose is to centralize and manage external integrations within the application architecture. The comment indicates this is part of a larger codebase (likely an educational tool named "teammates"). In under 100 words, this is a packaging structure for external service integrations.
