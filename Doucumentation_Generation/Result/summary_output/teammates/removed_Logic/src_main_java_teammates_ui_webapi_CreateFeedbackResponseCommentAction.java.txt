This code implements an API endpoint for creating feedback response comments in an educational platform. It handles three scenarios: student submissions, instructor submissions, and instructor results. For each, it validates access rights, checks session/question validity, verifies response ownership, and ensures proper comment visibility settings. The comment is then created and returned as JSON. The code includes extensive validation for parameters, user permissions, and entity existence to maintain data integrity.
