The `InstructorPrivilegesLegacy` class is a deprecated data transfer object that stores instructor privileges at three hierarchical levels (course, section, session) using nested maps of strings to booleans. It provides getter methods for each level but exists only for backward compatibility with older database entries, with newer implementations recommended for business logic.
