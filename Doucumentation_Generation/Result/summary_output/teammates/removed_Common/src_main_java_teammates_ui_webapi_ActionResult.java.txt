The `ActionResult` class is an abstract base class representing the result of executing an `Action`. It stores an HTTP status code and provides a method (`send`) to package and forward the result to an HTTP response. Subclasses must implement `send` to handle specific response types. The `getStatusCode` method allows access to the stored status code. This class serves as a foundation for different types of action results in a web API. (94 words)
