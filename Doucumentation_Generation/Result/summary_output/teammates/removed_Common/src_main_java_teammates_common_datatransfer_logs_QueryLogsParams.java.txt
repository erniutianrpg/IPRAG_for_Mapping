The `QueryLogsParams` class is a Java data transfer object that encapsulates parameters for querying logs, including filters like severity, time range, trace ID, user info, and more. It uses a builder pattern to construct instances with optional parameters, providing flexibility in specifying search criteria for log retrieval. The class includes getters for all parameters and ensures immutability once built.
