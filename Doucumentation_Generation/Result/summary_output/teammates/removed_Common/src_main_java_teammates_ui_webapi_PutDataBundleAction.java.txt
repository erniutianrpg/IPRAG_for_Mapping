This code defines a `PutDataBundleAction` class that handles HTTP requests to persist a data bundle into a database. It requires admin privileges (only allowed in development server) and validates the request. The action deserializes the JSON request body into a `DataBundle`, persists it using business logic, and returns the persisted bundle as JSON. If validation fails, it throws an exception.
