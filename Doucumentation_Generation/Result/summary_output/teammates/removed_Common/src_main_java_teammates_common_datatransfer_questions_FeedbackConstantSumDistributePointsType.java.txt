This Java enum defines distribution options for points in constant sum questions:  
1. `DISTRIBUTE_ALL_UNEVENLY`: All options must have different points.  
2. `DISTRIBUTE_SOME_UNEVENLY`: Some options must differ in points.  
3. `NONE`: No restrictions on point distribution.  
Each option has a display text (e.g., "All options") accessible via `getDisplayedOption()`, which is also serialized to JSON using `@JsonValue`. (98 words)
