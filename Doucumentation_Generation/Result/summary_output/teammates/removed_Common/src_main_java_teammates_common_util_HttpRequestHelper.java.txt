The `HttpRequestHelper` class provides utility methods for handling HTTP requests. It includes functions to:  
1. Extract request parameters as a key-value map (supporting single/multiple values)  
2. Retrieve request headers while filtering sensitive ones in production  
3. Get a specific cookie's value from the request  
4. Read the request body payload as a string  

All methods are static and the class cannot be instantiated. It serves as a helper for common HTTP request operations. (98 words)
