This code retrieves and processes feedback session logs for a specific course. It checks instructor permissions, validates request parameters (course ID, student email, session name, log types, time range), and filters logs based on these parameters. The logs are grouped by session name and returned with associated student and session data. The action ensures logs are within a valid time range and handles invalid entries by filtering them out. The output is structured as `FeedbackSessionLogsData` containing grouped logs, student details, and session information.
