The `LocalLoggingService` class provides a local implementation of logging operations for testing purposes in a development environment. It maintains in-memory logs for feedback sessions and loads general logs from a JSON file with randomized timestamps. Key functionalities include:

1. Querying logs with various filters (severity, timestamp, trace ID, etc.)
2. Creating and retrieving feedback session logs
3. Supporting pagination and sorting for log queries
4. Applying detailed filtering for exceptions and request logs

The class simulates cloud logging services locally, primarily for testing feedback session logging without external dependencies.
