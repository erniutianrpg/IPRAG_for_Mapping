The `InstructorPermissionSet` class defines and manages permissions for instructors in a system, including abilities like modifying courses, instructors, sessions, students, and viewing/submitting session data. It provides getter/setter methods for each permission, methods to convert permissions to/from a legacy map format, copy functionality, and overrides for `equals()` and `hashCode()`. Essentially, it's a data transfer object that encapsulates an instructor's access rights within the system.
