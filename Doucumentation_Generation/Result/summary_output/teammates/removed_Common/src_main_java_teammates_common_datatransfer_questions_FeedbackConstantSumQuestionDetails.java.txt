This code implements a "Constant Sum" feedback question type where respondents distribute points among options or recipients. Key functionalities include:

1. Validating question setup (minimum options/points, unique options)
2. Enforcing distribution rules (total points, uneven distribution if required)
3. Validating responses (point totals, min/max constraints, uniqueness)
4. Managing question properties (options, points allocation, distribution settings)

The class handles both options-based and recipient-based distributions, with configurable constraints like minimum/maximum points per option and forced uneven distribution. It includes extensive error checking for various invalid scenarios.
