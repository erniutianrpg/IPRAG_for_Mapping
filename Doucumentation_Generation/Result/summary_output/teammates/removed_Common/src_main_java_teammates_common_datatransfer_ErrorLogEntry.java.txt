The `ErrorLogEntry` class represents a condensed error log entry, containing a message, severity level, and trace ID. It provides a static method `fromLogEntry` to convert a `GeneralLogEntry` into an `ErrorLogEntry`, extracting and formatting error details, including exception messages and stack traces if present. The class ensures only error-level logs (or higher) are processed and handles null checks for robustness.
