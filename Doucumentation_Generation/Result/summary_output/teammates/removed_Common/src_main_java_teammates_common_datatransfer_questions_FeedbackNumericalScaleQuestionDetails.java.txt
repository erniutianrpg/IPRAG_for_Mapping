This code defines a numerical scale feedback question type with validation logic. It includes:
1. Default scale range (1-5) and step (0.5)
2. Validation for question settings (min < max, step > 0)
3. Response validation to ensure answers are within range and match step increments
4. Methods to check if question changes require response deletion
5. Getters/setters for min, max, and step values
6. Basic structure for numerical scale questions in a feedback system
