The `FileHelper` utility class provides two static methods for reading files from the `resources` folder:  
1. `getResourceAsStream` returns an `InputStream` for the specified file.  
2. `readResourceFile` reads the entire content of the file as a `String` using UTF-8 encoding.  
The class is non-instantiable (private constructor) and uses the thread's classloader to access resources. (Word count: 58)
