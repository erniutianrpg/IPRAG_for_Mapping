The `RequestTracer` class tracks HTTP request information using thread-local storage. It stores trace/span IDs, initializes request timeouts, and provides methods to check remaining time before timeout, elapsed time, and request identifiers. If the request exceeds its timeout, it throws a `DeadlineExceededException`. This utility helps monitor and manage request lifecycle and timing in a multi-threaded environment.
