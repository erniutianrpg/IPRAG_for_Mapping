This code defines a `SendErrorReportAction` class that handles sending error reports to system administrators. It allows any user (even non-logged-in) to submit reports, which are logged as severe errors (triggering email alerts to admins). The report includes user info, request ID, subject, and content. The action returns a success message upon submission.
