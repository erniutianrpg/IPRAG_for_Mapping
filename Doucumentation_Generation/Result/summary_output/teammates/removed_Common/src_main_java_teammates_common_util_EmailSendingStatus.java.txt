The `EmailSendingStatus` class encapsulates the outcome of an email sending operation. It stores an HTTP status code, a message, and a boolean flag indicating success (true if status code is 200-299). The class provides getter methods to access these fields. This allows callers to easily check if an email was sent successfully and retrieve details about the operation.
