This code defines a `CreateFeedbackQuestionAction` class that handles the creation of a feedback question in a web API. It verifies the instructor's authentication and authorization to modify the session, then processes the request by validating the question details, giver-recipient visibility, and other parameters. If valid, it creates the feedback question and returns the question data in JSON format. The class ensures only logged-in instructors with appropriate permissions can perform this action.
