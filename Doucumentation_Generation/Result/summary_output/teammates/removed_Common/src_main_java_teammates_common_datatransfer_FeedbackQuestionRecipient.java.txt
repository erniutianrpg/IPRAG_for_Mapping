The `FeedbackQuestionRecipient` class represents a recipient for feedback questions, storing their name, identifier, section, and team. It provides constructors (one with all fields and another with just name and identifier), getter methods for each field, and overrides `equals()` and `hashCode()` to compare objects based on all fields. This ensures proper equality checks and hash-based storage.
