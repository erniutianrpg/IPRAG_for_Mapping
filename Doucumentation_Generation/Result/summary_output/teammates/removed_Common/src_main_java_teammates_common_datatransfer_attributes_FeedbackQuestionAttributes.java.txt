The `FeedbackQuestionAttributes` class is a data transfer object (DTO) representing feedback questions in a system. It encapsulates question details like session name, course ID, question text, type, visibility settings for responses/giver/recipient, and participant types. It provides methods for validation, serialization, comparison, and updating question attributes. The class includes builder patterns for creating and updating instances, and handles sanitization and removal of irrelevant visibility options based on question settings. It serves as an intermediary between storage entities and business logic for feedback questions.
