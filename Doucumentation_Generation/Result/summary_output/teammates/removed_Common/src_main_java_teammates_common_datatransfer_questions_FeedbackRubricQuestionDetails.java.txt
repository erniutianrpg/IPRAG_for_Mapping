This code defines a `FeedbackRubricQuestionDetails` class that handles the structure and validation logic for rubric-type feedback questions. It manages rubric components like choices, sub-questions, descriptions, and weights, enforcing constraints (e.g., minimum choices/sub-questions). The class validates question setup and responses, checks for required response deletions when questions change, and provides getters/setters for rubric attributes. Key functionalities include validating rubric dimensions, weights, and ensuring responses match the rubric structure.
