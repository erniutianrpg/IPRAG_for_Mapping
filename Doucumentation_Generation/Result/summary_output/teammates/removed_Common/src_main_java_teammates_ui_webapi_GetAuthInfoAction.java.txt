This code handles authentication information retrieval in a web API. For unauthenticated users, it generates login URLs for different user roles (student, instructor, admin, maintainer) with optional redirect URLs. For authenticated users, it returns their user info. It also manages CSRF token validation, creating a new token cookie if none exists or if it doesn't match the current session. The endpoint is publicly accessible (no authentication required) and doesn't perform login/logout operations.
