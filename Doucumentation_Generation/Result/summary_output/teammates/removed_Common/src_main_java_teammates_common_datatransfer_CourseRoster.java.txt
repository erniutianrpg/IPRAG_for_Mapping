The `CourseRoster` class caches and manages student and instructor data for a course. It stores students and instructors in maps keyed by email, builds a team-to-members mapping, and provides methods to check membership (students in course/team, same team), retrieve participant details, and get student/instructor objects by email. It also includes a nested `ParticipantInfo` class to transfer participant information (name, team, section). This serves as an efficient in-memory cache to avoid repeated database queries.
