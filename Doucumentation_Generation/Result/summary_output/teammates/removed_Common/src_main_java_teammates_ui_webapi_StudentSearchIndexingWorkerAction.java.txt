This code is a worker action that indexes a student for search functionality. It takes a course ID and student email as input, retrieves the corresponding student record, and attempts to index it. If indexing fails with a `SearchServiceException`, it returns a 502 error to trigger an automatic retry. On success, it returns a "Successful" message. The action is restricted to admin users only.
