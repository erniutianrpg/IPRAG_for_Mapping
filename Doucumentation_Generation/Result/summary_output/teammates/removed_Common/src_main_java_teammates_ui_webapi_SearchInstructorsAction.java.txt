This code defines a `SearchInstructorsAction` class that searches for instructors across the entire system based on a provided search key. It's an admin-only action that returns instructor data including additional admin-specific information (like unique key, institution, and Google ID). If the search fails, it returns an error. The results are packaged into a `InstructorsData` object and returned as JSON.
