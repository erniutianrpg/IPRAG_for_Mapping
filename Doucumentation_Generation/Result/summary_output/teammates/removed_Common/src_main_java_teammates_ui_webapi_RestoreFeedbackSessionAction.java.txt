This code defines a REST API action (`RestoreFeedbackSessionAction`) that restores a feedback session from the recycle bin in a course management system. It checks if the requesting instructor has modification privileges, verifies the session exists in the recycle bin, restores it, and returns the restored session data with the instructor's privileges. The action requires the user to be logged in and authorized.
