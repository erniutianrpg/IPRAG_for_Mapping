The `JsonUtils` class provides utility methods for JSON serialization and deserialization using Gson. It handles custom types like `Instant`, `ZoneId`, `Duration`, `FeedbackQuestionDetails`, `FeedbackResponseDetails`, and `LogDetails` through type adapters. Key features include: converting objects to JSON (with pretty-print or compact format), parsing JSON strings into objects or `JsonElement`, and supporting type-safe deserialization for polymorphic types. The class is thread-safe with synchronized adapters and avoids HTML escaping in JSON output.
