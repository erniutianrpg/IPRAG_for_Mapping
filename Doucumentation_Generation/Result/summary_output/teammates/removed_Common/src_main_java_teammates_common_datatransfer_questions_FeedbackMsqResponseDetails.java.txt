The `FeedbackMsqResponseDetails` class handles multiple-select question (MSQ) feedback responses. It stores selected answers (including an optional "other" answer), tracks if "other" was selected, and stores the content of the "other" field. It provides methods to get/set answers, check for "other" selection, and get/set "other" field content. The `getAnswerString()` method formats answers as a comma-separated string. This class extends `FeedbackResponseDetails` for MSQ-specific functionality. (98 words)
