This code defines an enum `LogSeverity` that represents different levels of log severity (DEFAULT, DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL), each associated with an integer value. The enum provides a method `getSeverityLevel()` to retrieve the numeric value of each severity level. This allows for standardized log severity classification in the application. (58 words)
