This code creates a new instructor account with sample demo courses. It validates a registration key, sets a default timezone if needed, and checks if the account request exists and hasn't been used. It then generates a unique demo course ID based on the instructor's email, imports demo course data with adjusted timestamps for the instructor's timezone, and links the instructor to the course. Finally, it marks the account request as registered. The demo course ID generation handles duplicates by appending incrementing numbers if needed.
