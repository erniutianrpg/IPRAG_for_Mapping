This code defines a class `FeedbackRankOptionsResponseDetails` that handles rank-option feedback responses. It stores a list of integer answers and provides methods to: filter out unsubmitted values (`POINTS_NOT_SUBMITTED`), sort the answers, and return them as a formatted string (without brackets). The class also includes standard getter/setter methods for the answers list. It extends a parent class for generic feedback response details.
