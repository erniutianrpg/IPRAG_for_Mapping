The `RequestLogDetails` class extends `LogDetails` to store HTTP request log information, including response status, time, method, URL, user agent, instance ID, version, referrer, request parameters/headers/body, action class, and user info. It provides getters/setters for these fields and overrides `hideSensitiveInformation()` to nullify sensitive data (headers, params, body, user info) and remove query parameters from the referrer URL. This class is designed for structured HTTP request logging with privacy protection. (98 words)
