This code is a worker action that sends reminder emails to specific students and instructors for a feedback session in a course. It validates the request, retrieves the session details, identifies the users to remind (both students and instructors), generates reminder emails, and queues them for sending. If enabled, it also sends a copy to the requesting instructor. Errors are logged if email sending fails. The action returns a success message upon completion.
