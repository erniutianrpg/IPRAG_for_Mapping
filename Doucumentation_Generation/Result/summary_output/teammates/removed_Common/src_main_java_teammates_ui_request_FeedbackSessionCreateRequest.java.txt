This code defines a `FeedbackSessionCreateRequest` class that extends `FeedbackSessionBasicRequest` for creating feedback sessions. It includes fields for the session name and optional fields to copy from an existing session in another course. The class provides getters and setters for these fields and overrides a `validate()` method to ensure the session name isn't null/empty and that copying parameters are consistent. Validation fails if these conditions aren't met. (98 words)
