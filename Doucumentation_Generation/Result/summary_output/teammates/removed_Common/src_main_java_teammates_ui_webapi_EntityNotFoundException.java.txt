The `EntityNotFoundException` class is a custom runtime exception that indicates a requested entity was not found. It serves as a wrapper for `EntityDoesNotExistException` and represents an HTTP 404 error. The class provides two constructors: one that accepts an `EntityDoesNotExistException` to preserve its message and cause, and another that takes a custom error message string. This exception is used to handle cases where requested data doesn't exist in the system.
