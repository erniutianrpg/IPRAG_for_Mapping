The `ActionFactory` class maps HTTP request URIs and methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to corresponding action classes. It initializes a static mapping of URI-method pairs to action classes during class loading. The `getAction` method uses this mapping to instantiate and return the appropriate action class based on the request URI and method, throwing exceptions for invalid mappings. This serves as a centralized router for handling different API endpoints in the application.
