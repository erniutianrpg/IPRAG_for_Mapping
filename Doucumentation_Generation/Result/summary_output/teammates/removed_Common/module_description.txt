This module serves as the core backend system for an educational platform (Teammates), providing comprehensive functionality for course management, feedback collection, and user administration. It offers a RESTful API for instructors and students to manage courses, feedback sessions, and user accounts, with robust authentication and authorization controls. The system handles various feedback question types (MCQ, rubric, numerical scale, etc.), supports automated email notifications, and includes logging and monitoring capabilities. Key features include student enrollment, feedback session management, search functionality, and data analytics, all implemented with proper validation, error handling, and security measures. The architecture follows a layered design with clear separation between data transfer objects, business logic, and web API controllers.
