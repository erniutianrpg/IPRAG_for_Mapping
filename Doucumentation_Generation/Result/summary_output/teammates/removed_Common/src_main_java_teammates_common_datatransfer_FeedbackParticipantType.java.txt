This Java enum `FeedbackParticipantType` defines different roles involved in feedback questions/responses in an educational system. Each enum value represents a participant type (e.g., students, instructors, teams) with three boolean flags indicating whether they can be givers, recipients, or viewers of feedback. The class includes methods to check these capabilities (`isValidGiver/Recipient/Viewer`), determine if a type is team-related (`isTeam`), and convert types to singular nouns (`toSingularFormString`). It essentially models the permissions and display formats for various feedback participants in a course.
