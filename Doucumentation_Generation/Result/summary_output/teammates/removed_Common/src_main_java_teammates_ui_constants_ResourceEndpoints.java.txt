This code defines an enum `ResourceEndpoints` that maps various API endpoint constants to their corresponding URI strings from `ResourceURIs`. Each enum value represents a specific API endpoint (e.g., error reporting, authentication, courses, sessions) and stores its associated URL. The `@JsonValue` annotation ensures the URL string is used when serializing the enum to JSON. Essentially, it provides a centralized, type-safe way to reference API endpoints throughout the application.
