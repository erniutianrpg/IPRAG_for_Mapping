The `TaskWrapper` class encapsulates a task to be added to a task queue, storing the queue name, worker URL, parameters (as key-value pairs), and an optional request body. It provides getter methods to access these fields but no setters, making it immutable once created. This class serves as a container for task-related data in a task queue system. (98 words)
