This code defines a `FeedbackSessionAttributes` class that represents a feedback session in an educational system. It stores session details like name, course ID, timings (start, end, visibility), email notifications status, deadlines for students/instructors, and validation rules. The class provides methods to check session status (open/closed/visible), create copies for specific users, validate attributes, and update session properties through a builder pattern. It also handles conversion to/from persistent storage entities and includes equality checks.
