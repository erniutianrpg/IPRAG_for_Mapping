This code defines a `FeedbackMsqQuestionDetails` class for handling Multiple-Select Questions (MSQ) in a feedback system. It manages question options, weights, validation rules (like minimum/maximum selections, duplicate options, empty values), and response validation. Key features include support for "Other" option, weighted choices, and configurable selection limits. The class ensures data integrity through comprehensive validation checks for both question setup and responses.
