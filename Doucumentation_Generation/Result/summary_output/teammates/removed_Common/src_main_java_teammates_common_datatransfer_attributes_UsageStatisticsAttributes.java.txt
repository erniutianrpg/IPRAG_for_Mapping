The `UsageStatisticsAttributes` class is a data transfer object (DTO) that represents usage statistics for a system. It tracks metrics like number of responses, courses, students, instructors, account requests, emails, and submissions within a specific time period. The class provides methods to create instances from database entities (`valueOf`), make copies (`getCopy`), convert to entities (`toEntity`), and compare objects. It uses a builder pattern for immutable object creation and includes basic validation. The class serves as an intermediary between storage entities and application logic for usage statistics.
