This code defines an enum `LogEvent` that represents different types of logging events (e.g., requests, exceptions, emails) in a system. Each enum value is associated with a specific class (`LogDetails` subclass) that provides details for that event type. The enum includes a constructor to set the details class and a getter method to retrieve it. Essentially, it serves as a catalog of loggable events and their corresponding detail classes. (99 words)
