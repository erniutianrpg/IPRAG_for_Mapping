The `FeedbackSessionAuditLogDetails` class extends `LogDetails` to store and manage audit log data for feedback sessions. It includes fields like `courseId`, `feedbackSessionName`, `studentEmail`, and `accessType`, with getters and setters for each. The `hideSensitiveInformation()` method nullifies sensitive fields (courseId, session name, student email) for privacy. It's specifically used for `FEEDBACK_SESSION_AUDIT` log events.
