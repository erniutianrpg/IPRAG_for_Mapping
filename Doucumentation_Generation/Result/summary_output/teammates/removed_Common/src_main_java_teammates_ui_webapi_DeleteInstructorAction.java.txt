This code defines a `DeleteInstructorAction` class that handles deleting an instructor from a course, with safeguards. It checks if the requester is an admin or an instructor with modify permissions. The action prevents deletion if the instructor is the last one in the course. It ensures there's at least one other instructor who can modify instructors and one visible to students before allowing deletion. The operation returns a success message upon completion or throws exceptions for unauthorized access or invalid operations.
