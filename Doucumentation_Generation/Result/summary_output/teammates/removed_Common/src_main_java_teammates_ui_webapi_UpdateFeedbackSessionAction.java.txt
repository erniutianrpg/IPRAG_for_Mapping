This code updates a feedback session in a course management system. It validates the instructor's access, checks for valid submission/visibility times, updates session details (including deadlines for students/instructors), and processes deadline extensions by creating, updating, or revoking them. It also sends notification emails about deadline changes if requested. The updated session data is returned as a JSON response.
