The `TeamEvalResult` class processes peer evaluation data for a team. It takes a 2D array of student-submitted scores, normalizes them, calculates peer contribution ratios, and computes average perceived scores. Key functionalities include sanitizing inputs (handling missing/unsure values), normalizing scores to a common scale, removing self-ratings, and adjusting results to match students' claims. The output includes normalized/denormalized scores for instructors and students. Special values like NA (uninitialized), NSU (not sure), and NSB (not submitted) are handled throughout.
