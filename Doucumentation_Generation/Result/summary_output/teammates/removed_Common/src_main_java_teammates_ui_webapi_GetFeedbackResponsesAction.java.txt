This code handles an API request to retrieve all feedback responses given by a user (student or instructor) for a specific feedback question. It checks access control based on the user's role (student or instructor), verifies the question exists and is answerable, then fetches and formats the responses. For MCQ/MSQ questions, it includes participant comments if available. The result is returned as a JSON object containing the list of responses.
