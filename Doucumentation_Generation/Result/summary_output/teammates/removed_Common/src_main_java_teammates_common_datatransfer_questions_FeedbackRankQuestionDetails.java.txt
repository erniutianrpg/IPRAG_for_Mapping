This abstract Java class `FeedbackRankQuestionDetails` provides common functionality for rank-based feedback questions. It extends `FeedbackQuestionDetails` and manages three key properties: minimum/maximum options to be ranked (initialized to no value) and whether duplicate rankings are allowed. The class includes getters and setters for these properties, serving as a base for specific rank question types (options or recipients). It encapsulates the core logic for ranking constraints in feedback questions.
