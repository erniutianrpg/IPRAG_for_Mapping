This code defines a `GetStudentAction` class that retrieves a student's information from a course. It checks access control based on whether the requester is an instructor (via email) or a student (via registration key or Google ID). If authorized, it returns the student's data, hiding sensitive information for non-instructors. Admins get additional details like the student's key and Google ID. The API throws unauthorized access or not found errors for invalid requests.
