This code defines a Java package named `teammates.common.exception` that serves as a container for custom exception classes used throughout the application. The package's purpose is to centralize all application-specific exceptions, making them easier to manage and maintain. The documentation comment indicates these exceptions are used across the entire application. In under 100 words, this creates a dedicated namespace for handling unique error conditions in a consistent way.
