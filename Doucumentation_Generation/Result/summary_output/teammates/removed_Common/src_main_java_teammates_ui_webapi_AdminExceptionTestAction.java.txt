The `AdminExceptionTestAction` class is a testing utility that intentionally throws various exceptions to verify API servlet's error handling. It checks for a specific error parameter in the request and throws corresponding exceptions (like `NullPointerException`, `DeadlineExceededException`, etc.) or returns a test output if no matching error is found. Access is restricted to development servers only. This helps test the system's exception management without affecting production. (98 words)
