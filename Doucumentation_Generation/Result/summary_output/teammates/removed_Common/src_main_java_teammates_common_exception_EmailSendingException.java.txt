The `EmailSendingException` is a custom exception class that indicates an error occurred while sending an email. It extends Java's `Exception` class and includes a status code field to store the HTTP status code associated with the failure. The exception takes a `Throwable` cause and status code as parameters, and provides a getter method (`getStatusCode()`) to retrieve the status code. This helps in identifying and handling email sending failures with specific error codes. (94 words)
