The `DeleteStudentAction` class is a web API action that deletes a student from a course. It requires the user to be logged in as an instructor or admin with permission to modify students. The action takes either a student ID or email as input, finds the corresponding student, and deletes them from the course (including cascading effects). If the student isn't found, it fails silently. Upon success, it returns a confirmation message.
