This code defines a `FeedbackMcqQuestionDetails` class for handling multiple-choice (single answer) questions in a feedback system. It includes:

1. Validation logic for question setup (minimum choices, duplicate options, weights)
2. Response validation (checking valid selections and 'other' option text)
3. Properties for MCQ configuration (choices, weights, 'other' option, dropdown)
4. Methods to determine if changes require response deletion
5. Getters/setters for all properties

The class ensures MCQ questions meet requirements like having enough choices, valid weights, and proper response handling.
