This code provides a utility class `HttpRequest` for executing HTTP GET requests. It sets a 30-second timeout, creates an HTTP client with this configuration, and sends a GET request to the specified URI. If the response status is 200 (OK), it returns the response body as a string; otherwise, it throws an `HttpResponseException` with the status code and response. The class is designed to be uninstantiable (utility class).
