This code sends join reminder emails to students or instructors who haven't registered for a course. It checks the requester's authorization, verifies the course exists, and then either sends an email to a specific student/instructor or to all unregistered students. The action returns a status message confirming the emails sent. Access is restricted to logged-in users with appropriate permissions.
