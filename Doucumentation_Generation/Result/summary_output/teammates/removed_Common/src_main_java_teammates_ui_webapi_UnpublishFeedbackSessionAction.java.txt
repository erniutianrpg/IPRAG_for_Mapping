This code defines an API action to unpublish a feedback session in a course. It checks if the requesting instructor has modification rights, verifies if the session is published, then unpublishes it. If email notifications were enabled, it schedules an unpublish notification email. The action returns the updated session data or appropriate error messages if the session doesn't exist or parameters are invalid. Requires logged-in access with instructor privileges.
