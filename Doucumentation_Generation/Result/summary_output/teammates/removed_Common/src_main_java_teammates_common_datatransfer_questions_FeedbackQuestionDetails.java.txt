This abstract class `FeedbackQuestionDetails` serves as a base for different feedback question types in an educational system. It defines common properties (question type and text) and methods for validation, response handling, and statistics generation. Key functionalities include checking if response deletion is needed after edits, validating questions and responses, managing visibility rules, and handling JSON serialization for deep copying and equality checks. Concrete question types extend this class to implement specific behaviors.
