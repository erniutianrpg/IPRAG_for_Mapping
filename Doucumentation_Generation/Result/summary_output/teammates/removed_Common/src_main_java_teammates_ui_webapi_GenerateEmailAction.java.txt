This code is an admin-only API action that generates email content for students in a course. It takes a course ID, student email, and email type as input, then generates either a course join email or a feedback session reminder email based on the specified type. For feedback session reminders, it also requires a session name. The action validates the inputs, checks if the course and student exist, then creates and returns the appropriate email content in JSON format.
