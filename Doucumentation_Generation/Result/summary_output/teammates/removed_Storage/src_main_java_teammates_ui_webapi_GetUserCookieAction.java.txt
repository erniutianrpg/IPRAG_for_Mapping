The `GetUserCookieAction` class is a backend API action that generates and returns an encrypted user cookie for a given user ID. It requires backdoor key access for authorization. When executed, it creates a `UserInfoCookie` for the specified user, converts it to a compact JSON string, encrypts it, and returns the result. This is typically used for authentication purposes in the system. The action is restricted to internal/backdoor access only.
