This code defines an API action (`UpdateStudentAction`) that allows instructors to edit a student's details in a course. It validates instructor permissions, updates the student's information (name, email, team, section, comments), and cascades these changes. If the email is changed, it resets the student's Google ID and optionally sends a notification email. The action returns appropriate success/failure messages and handles various exceptions like invalid parameters or existing entities.
