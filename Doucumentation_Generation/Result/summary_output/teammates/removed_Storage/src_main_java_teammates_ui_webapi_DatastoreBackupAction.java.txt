This code implements a cron job for performing Google Cloud Datastore backups. It checks if backups are enabled and skips if in dev environment or disabled. It authenticates with Google Cloud, constructs a backup request with a timestamped output location in Google Cloud Storage, and executes the backup via a REST API call. The response is logged, indicating success or failure. The backup is saved to a specified GCS bucket with a timestamp prefix.
