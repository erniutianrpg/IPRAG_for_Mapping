This code defines a Java package named `teammates.storage.entity` that contains classes representing persistable entities. These entities are likely used for database storage operations, serving as the data model layer in the application. The package's purpose is to group all classes that map to database tables or documents, enabling data persistence in the application. The brief documentation indicates these classes are specifically designed to be stored (persisted) in a database.
