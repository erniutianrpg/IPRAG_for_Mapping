This code defines a `GetDeadlineExtensionAction` class that retrieves deadline extension information for a user (student/instructor) in a specific course and feedback session. It requires admin-level access and only works in development environments. The action takes course ID, session name, user email, and role as parameters, fetches the corresponding deadline extension from the database, and returns it as JSON. If no extension is found, it throws an `EntityNotFoundException`.
