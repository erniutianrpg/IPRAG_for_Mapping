The `OriginCheckFilter` is a servlet filter that validates HTTP request origins to prevent CSRF attacks. It checks: 1) allowed HTTP methods/headers in dev mode, 2) CSRF tokens for POST/PUT/DELETE requests, 3) App Engine queue headers, and 4) HTTP referrer validity. Requests with missing/invalid CSRF tokens or mismatched referrers are denied with a 403 error. Legitimate requests (valid CSRF tokens, matching referrers, or from App Engine) are allowed to proceed. The filter ensures requests originate from trusted sources.
