This code defines a `GetStudentAction` class that retrieves a student's information from a course. It handles three access scenarios: 1) instructors accessing a student's data (with proper permissions), 2) unregistered students accessing their own data via registration key, and 3) registered students accessing their own data. The method performs authorization checks and returns the student's data in a `StudentData` object, hiding sensitive information when accessed by non-instructors. Admins get additional details like the student's key and Google ID. It throws unauthorized access or not found exceptions when appropriate.
