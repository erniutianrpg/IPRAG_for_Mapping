The `QueryLogsAction` class is an admin-only API endpoint that queries system logs with various filters like time range, severity, trace ID, user info, and more. It validates input parameters, sets default values (e.g., 24-hour time window, INFO severity), and processes the query. Admins can access additional filters (e.g., student ID, email). Sensitive fields are hidden for non-admin users. The results are paginated (default 50 entries/page) and returned as JSON.
