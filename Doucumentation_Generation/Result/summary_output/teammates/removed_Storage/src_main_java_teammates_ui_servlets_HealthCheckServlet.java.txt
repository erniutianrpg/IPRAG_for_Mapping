The `HealthCheckServlet` is a simple HTTP servlet that handles server health checks. When accessed via a GET request, it responds with an HTTP 200 (OK) status and the text "OK", indicating the server is reachable. Note that this only confirms server availability, not the status of dependent components like databases or cloud services.
