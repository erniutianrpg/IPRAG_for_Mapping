This servlet maps legacy URLs to new ones for backward compatibility, primarily for URLs sent via email. It handles various cases like course join pages, home pages, and feedback submission/results pages for both students and instructors. For each legacy URL, it constructs a corresponding new URL with necessary parameters and redirects the request. Unmapped URLs default to the root ("/") with a warning. The class is marked as deprecated, indicating it should be phased out eventually.
