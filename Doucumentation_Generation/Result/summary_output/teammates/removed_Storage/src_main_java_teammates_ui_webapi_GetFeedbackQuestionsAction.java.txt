This code handles API requests to retrieve feedback questions for a feedback session in a course. It checks access permissions based on the requester's role (student/instructor) and intent (submission/result viewing). Depending on the intent, it fetches relevant questions, populates necessary fields, and filters questions if moderated. The response normalizes question numbers and hides sensitive information for students. Access is controlled through various checks to ensure only authorized users can view the questions.
