The `DeleteCourseAction` class is a web API endpoint that handles course deletion. It requires the user to be a logged-in instructor with modification privileges for the specified course. After verifying access rights, it deletes the course and all associated data using `deleteCourseCascade`, then returns a success message ("OK"). The action ensures only authorized instructors can delete courses. (98 words)
