This code defines a `DeleteAccountAction` class that handles the deletion of a user account (student or instructor) in an admin-only API endpoint. It retrieves the user's Google ID from the request parameters, cascades the deletion (including associated data) via the `logic.deleteAccountCascade` method, and returns a success message upon completion. The action is restricted to administrators only.
