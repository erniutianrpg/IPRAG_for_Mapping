This code implements a database access layer for managing feedback sessions in an educational platform. It provides CRUD operations for FeedbackSession entities, including methods to:

1. Retrieve ongoing, soft-deleted, or course-specific feedback sessions
2. Find sessions needing email notifications (opening, closing, published)
3. Update, soft-delete, restore, or permanently delete sessions
4. Validate session attributes before saving

The class uses Objectify for Google Datastore operations and includes business logic for session management, email notifications, and soft deletion handling. It follows a singleton pattern and extends a base EntitiesDb class for common database operations.
