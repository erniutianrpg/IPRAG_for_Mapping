The `DeadlineExtensionsDb` class manages CRUD operations for deadline extensions in a database. It provides methods to:
- Get, update, and delete deadline extensions by course, session, user, and role
- Update user emails across all deadline extensions
- Delete extensions based on query parameters
- Retrieve extensions needing closing emails
- Validate operations and handle exceptions

The class uses Objectify for database operations and enforces data integrity through assertions and validations. It's a singleton that converts between entity objects and attributes for business logic.
