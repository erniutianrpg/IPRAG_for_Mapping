The `EntityNotFoundException` class is a custom runtime exception that indicates a requested entity was not found. It serves as a wrapper for `EntityDoesNotExistException` or can be created with a custom message. This exception corresponds to an HTTP 404 (Not Found) error, signaling that the requested resource doesn't exist. It provides two constructors: one accepting an `EntityDoesNotExistException` and another accepting a string message.
