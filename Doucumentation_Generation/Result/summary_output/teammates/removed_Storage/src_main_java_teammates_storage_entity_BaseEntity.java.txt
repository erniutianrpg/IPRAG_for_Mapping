This code provides a base class for database entities and includes an `InstantTranslatorFactory` to handle conversion between Java `Instant` objects and Google Cloud Datastore `Timestamp` values. The translator ensures seamless serialization/deserialization of timestamp fields when storing/retrieving entities, converting `Instant` to `Timestamp` for storage and vice versa for loading. The class leverages Objectify's translation framework for this type conversion.
