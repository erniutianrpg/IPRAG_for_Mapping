This code defines a `Course` entity class for object persistence using Objectify. It represents a course with fields like ID, name, creation/deletion timestamps, timezone, and institute. The class includes constructors (one empty for Objectify, one for initialization), getters, and setters. Default values are set for timezone (if null) and creation timestamp (current time if null). The entity is annotated for Google Datastore operations with `@Entity`, `@Index`, and `@Id` for the primary key.
