This code defines an `AccountRequest` entity class for storing account request data in a database (using Objectify). It includes fields like email, name, institute, registration key, and timestamps. The class generates a unique ID by combining email and institute, and creates a secure registration key using encryption. It provides getters/setters for all fields and ensures string fields are trimmed. The entity tracks creation and registration timestamps.
