This code defines a `PutDataBundleAction` class that handles HTTP requests to persist a data bundle into a database. It requires admin privileges and only works in development environments. The action accepts a JSON request body, converts it to a `DataBundle` object, persists it via a `logic` service, and returns the persisted data as JSON. If the data is invalid or unauthorized access is detected, it throws appropriate exceptions.
