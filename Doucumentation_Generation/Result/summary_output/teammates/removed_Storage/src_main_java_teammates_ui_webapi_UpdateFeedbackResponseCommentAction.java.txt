This code updates a feedback response comment in a course management system. It handles three types of user intents: student submission, instructor submission, and instructor result. For each intent, it verifies the user's access rights, checks if the session is open, and validates the comment content. The comment text, visibility settings, and editor information are updated. The action returns the updated comment data or appropriate error messages if validation fails.
