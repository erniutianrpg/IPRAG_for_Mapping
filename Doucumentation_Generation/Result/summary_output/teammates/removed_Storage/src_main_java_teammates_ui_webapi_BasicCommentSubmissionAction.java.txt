This abstract class `BasicCommentSubmissionAction` extends `BasicFeedbackSubmissionAction` and provides common validation methods for feedback response comments in an educational system. It includes methods to:  
1. Validate if a question allows comments on responses  
2. Check if a comment already exists for a response  
3. Verify student/instructor ownership of a response before allowing comment operations  
4. Throw appropriate exceptions for invalid operations or unauthorized access  

The class ensures proper authorization and validity checks before comment submissions.
