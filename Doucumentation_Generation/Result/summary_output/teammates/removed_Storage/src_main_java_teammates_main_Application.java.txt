This code is the entry point for a Java web application using Jetty server. It initializes a Jetty server on a configured port, sets up a web application context with the specified WAR file path, and optionally adds a development server login servlet if enabled. The code also includes lifecycle listeners for logging startup, shutdown, and failure events, along with timezone information. Finally, it starts the server and keeps it running until shutdown.
