This code defines a `GetTimeZonesAction` API endpoint that returns supported time zones and their UTC offsets. It requires admin/maintainer access. The action retrieves the current UTC time zone version, collects all available time zone IDs (excluding "SystemV" zones), calculates their current UTC offsets in seconds, and returns the data in a structured format (`TimeZonesData`) with the time zone version and offset map.
