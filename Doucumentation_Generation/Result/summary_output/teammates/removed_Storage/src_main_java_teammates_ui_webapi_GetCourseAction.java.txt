This code defines a `GetCourseAction` class that retrieves course details for either an instructor or a student. It checks access control based on the user's role (admin, instructor, or student) and throws exceptions if unauthorized. For instructors, it includes their privileges; for students, it hides sensitive information. The course data is returned as a JSON response. The endpoint is publicly accessible but enforces role-based permissions.
