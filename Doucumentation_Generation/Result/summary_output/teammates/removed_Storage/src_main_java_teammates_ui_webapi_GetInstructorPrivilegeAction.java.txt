This code defines a `GetInstructorPrivilegeAction` API endpoint that retrieves an instructor's privileges in a specific course. It requires the user to be logged in and either be an admin or the instructor of the course. The endpoint accepts a course ID and optionally an instructor ID or email. It fetches the instructor's privileges and returns them as JSON. Access is denied if the requesting user isn't an admin or the specified instructor.
