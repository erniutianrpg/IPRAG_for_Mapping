The `SearchManagerFactory` is a singleton factory class that provides and registers three types of search managers: `InstructorSearchManager`, `StudentSearchManager`, and `AccountRequestSearchManager`. It ensures only one instance of each manager exists by allowing registration only if the instance is null. The class prevents direct instantiation and offers static getter methods to access the registered instances. Registration typically occurs once during application startup.
