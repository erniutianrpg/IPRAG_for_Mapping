The `InstructorsDb` class manages CRUD operations for instructor entities in a database. It provides methods to:
- Create, update, delete, and retrieve instructors by various attributes (email, Google ID, course ID, registration key)
- Search instructors across the system
- Regenerate instructor registration keys
- Check instructor existence
- Handle instructor privileges and display settings
- Maintain search indexes for instructors
- Count instructors within time ranges

The class uses Objectify for database operations and implements a singleton pattern. It converts between entity objects (`Instructor`) and data transfer objects (`InstructorAttributes`).
