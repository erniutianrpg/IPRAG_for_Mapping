This module serves as the core backend system for an educational platform, providing comprehensive functionality for course management, feedback sessions, user administration, and data persistence. It implements a RESTful API layer with role-based access control for instructors, students, and administrators, handling operations such as course creation, student enrollment, feedback session management, and account requests. The system features robust database integration with CRUD operations, search capabilities, and scheduled tasks like email notifications and data backups. Security measures include authentication, CSRF protection, and input validation, while the architecture separates concerns between API endpoints, business logic, and storage layers. The module supports both real-time interactions and background processing through worker actions, with extensive error handling and logging throughout.
