The `CoursesDb` class manages CRUD operations for courses in a database using Objectify. It provides methods to:
- Get single/multiple courses by ID
- Update course attributes with validation
- Delete courses (hard and soft delete)
- Restore soft-deleted courses
- Count courses within a time range
- Check for existing courses

It extends `EntitiesDb` for common database operations and uses `CourseAttributes` for data transfer. The class follows a singleton pattern and includes validation checks for updates.
