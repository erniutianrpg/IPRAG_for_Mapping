The `WebPageServlet` is a Java servlet that handles GET requests by forwarding them to `index.html`. If a `BadMessageException` occurs, it logs a warning, returns a 400 Bad Request status, and writes the exception message to the response. Other runtime exceptions are rethrown. Essentially, it serves the main web page while handling specific errors gracefully. (94 words)
