This code launches a local Google Cloud Datastore emulator for development/testing purposes. It configures the emulator with a 0.9 consistency level, uses a port from the Config class, enables disk persistence, and sets a data directory. The emulator starts when the `main` method is executed. The class is final with a private constructor to prevent instantiation.
