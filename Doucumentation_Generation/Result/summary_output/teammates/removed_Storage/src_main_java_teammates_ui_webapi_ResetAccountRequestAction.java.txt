This code defines a `ResetAccountRequestAction` class that handles resetting an account request for an instructor. It verifies the request's validity, checks if the instructor is registered, resets the registration timestamp, generates a new join link, and sends it via email. The action is restricted to admin users only. If errors occur (e.g., invalid parameters or missing entity), it returns appropriate HTTP status codes. The output includes the new join link.
