This code defines a `SearchInstructorsAction` class that searches for instructors across the entire system based on a provided search key. It's an admin-only action that returns a list of instructor data, including additional admin-specific information like unique keys, course institutes, and Google IDs. If the search fails, it returns an error message. The results are packaged into a JSON response containing the instructor details.
