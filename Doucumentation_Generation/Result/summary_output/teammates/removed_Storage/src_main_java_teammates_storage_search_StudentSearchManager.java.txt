The `StudentSearchManager` class provides search functionality for student data using Apache Solr. It extends a base `SearchManager` class to handle student-specific operations, including creating search documents from student attributes, retrieving students from search results, and sorting results by course, section, team, name, and email. It also implements a method to search students with query constraints based on instructor privileges, ensuring only authorized course data is returned. The class acts as a bridge between the application's student data and the Solr search service.
