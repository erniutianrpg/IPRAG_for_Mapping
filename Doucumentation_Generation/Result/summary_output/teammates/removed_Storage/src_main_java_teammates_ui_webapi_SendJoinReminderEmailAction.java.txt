This code handles sending join reminder emails to students or instructors who haven't registered for a course. It verifies the requester's authorization, checks if the course exists, and then sends emails either to a specific student/instructor or to all unregistered students. The action returns a confirmation message indicating the emails were sent. Access control ensures only authorized instructors can send reminders.
