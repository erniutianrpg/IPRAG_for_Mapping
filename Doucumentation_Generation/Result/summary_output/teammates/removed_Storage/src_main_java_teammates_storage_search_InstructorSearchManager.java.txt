The `InstructorSearchManager` class is a search proxy for instructor-related operations using Solr. It extends `SearchManager` to handle instructor documents, creating/searching them via `CoursesDb` and `InstructorsDb`. Key functions include: creating search documents from instructor attributes, retrieving instructors from Solr documents, sorting results by course, role, name, and email, and performing searches with a query string. It interfaces with a Solr backend to manage instructor data efficiently.
