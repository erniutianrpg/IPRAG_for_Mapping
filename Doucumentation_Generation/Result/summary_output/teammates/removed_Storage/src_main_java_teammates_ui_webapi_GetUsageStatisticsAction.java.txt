This code defines a `GetUsageStatisticsAction` class that retrieves usage statistics within a specified time range. It validates: 
1. User authentication (only admins/maintainers can access)
2. Valid start/end timestamps (must be numbers, start < end, not exceed current time)
3. Time range limit (max 184 days)
If valid, it fetches and returns usage statistics data between the timestamps.
