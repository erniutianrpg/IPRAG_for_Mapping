This code implements a database access layer for feedback response comments in an educational system. It provides CRUD operations and various query methods to retrieve comments by different criteria (e.g., by response ID, giver, course, session, or section). Key features include creating, updating, deleting comments, and bulk operations like updating email addresses. The class uses Objectify for Google Datastore operations and ensures data integrity through validation checks. It follows a singleton pattern and converts between entity objects and attributes.
