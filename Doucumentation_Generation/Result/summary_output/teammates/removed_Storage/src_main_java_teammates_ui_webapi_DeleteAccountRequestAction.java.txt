This code defines an admin-only action to delete an account request in a system. It checks if the request exists and if the associated instructor is already registered (preventing deletion if true). If valid, it deletes the account request and returns a success message. Key parameters are the instructor's email and institution. The action throws an error if attempting to delete a registered instructor's request.
