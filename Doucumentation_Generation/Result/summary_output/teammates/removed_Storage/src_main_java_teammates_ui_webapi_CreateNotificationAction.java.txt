This code creates a new notification banner in a system. It's an admin-only action that takes a request with notification details (start/end timestamps, style, target user, title, message), validates it, and creates a new notification with a unique UUID. If successful, it returns the created notification data; if invalid, it throws an exception; if a duplicate UUID occurs (unlikely), it logs an error and returns a 500 status.
