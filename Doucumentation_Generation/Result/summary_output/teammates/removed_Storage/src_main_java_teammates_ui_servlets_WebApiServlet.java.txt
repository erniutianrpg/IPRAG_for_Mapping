The `WebApiServlet` is a central HTTP servlet that handles all web requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for a web application. It delegates requests to appropriate `Action` classes via `ActionFactory`, executes them, and handles responses or errors. The servlet manages various exceptions (e.g., authentication failures, invalid requests, timeouts) by returning appropriate HTTP status codes and logging errors. It also differentiates between requests from App Engine queues and regular users for error handling. Finally, it logs request details, including status codes, user info, and request bodies.
