This code defines a `DeleteDataBundleAction` class that handles deleting a data bundle from the database. It requires admin privileges and only works in development servers. When executed, it parses a JSON request body into a `DataBundle` object, removes it using the `logic` service, and returns a success message. The action is restricted to users with full access rights.
