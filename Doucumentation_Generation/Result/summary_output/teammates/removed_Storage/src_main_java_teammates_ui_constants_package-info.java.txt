This code defines a Java package named `teammates.ui.constants` that serves as a centralized location for storing constants (fixed values) that need to be shared between the back-end and front-end of the application. The package's purpose is to maintain consistency and avoid duplication by providing a single source of truth for shared constant values. The comment indicates these constants are specifically meant to be accessible to the front-end.
