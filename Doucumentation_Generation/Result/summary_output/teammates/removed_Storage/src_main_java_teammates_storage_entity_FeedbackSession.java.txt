This code defines a `FeedbackSession` entity class representing an instructor-created feedback session in a system (likely an educational platform). It stores session details like name, course ID, creator email, timings (start, end, visibility), timezone, grace period, email notification flags, and custom deadlines for students/instructors. The class includes methods to generate a unique session ID and getter/setter methods for all fields. It's annotated for Objectify (Google Datastore) with indexing preferences for efficient querying.
