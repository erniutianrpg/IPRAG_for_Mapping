This code defines an API action (`GetSessionResponseStatsAction`) that retrieves and returns the response statistics (number of submissions vs. expected submissions) for a feedback session. It requires users to be logged in, with access control checks for instructors or admins. The action fetches the feedback session details using course ID and session name, calculates the actual and expected submission counts, and returns them as a `FeedbackSessionStatsData` JSON response.
