The `Account` class represents a user entity in the system, storing their Google ID, name, email, read notifications (with timestamps), and account creation time. It provides getters and setters for these fields and initializes the creation timestamp automatically. The class is annotated for Objectify (Google Cloud Datastore) with indexing and serialization directives. If `readNotifications` is null, it returns an empty map to avoid null references.
