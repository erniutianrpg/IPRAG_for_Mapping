This code defines an API action (`UpdateCourseAction`) that updates a course's details (name and timezone) in a system. It requires instructor-level authentication, verifies the instructor's permission to modify the course, validates the timezone, and updates the course via business logic. If successful, it returns the updated course data; otherwise, it throws appropriate exceptions for invalid requests or non-existent courses. The entire process is restricted to logged-in instructors with modification rights.
