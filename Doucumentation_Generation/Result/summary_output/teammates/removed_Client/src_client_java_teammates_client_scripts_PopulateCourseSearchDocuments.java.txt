This code is a data migration script that populates search documents for courses in a backend system. It processes courses created within a specified time range, retrieves associated students (in batches of 300) and instructors for each course, and uses a backdoor API to insert their data as searchable documents. The script tracks progress and prints logs during migration. It's designed to rebuild or update search indexes for course-related data.
