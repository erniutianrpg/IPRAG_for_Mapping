This code is a worker action that indexes an instructor for search functionality. It retrieves an instructor's details using a course ID and email, then attempts to index the instructor document. If indexing fails (throwing SearchServiceException), it returns a 502 status to trigger an automatic retry. On success, it returns a success message. The action is restricted to admin users only.
