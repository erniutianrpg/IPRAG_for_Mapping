This code calculates and stores usage statistics for a Teammates application over a one-hour period. It collects data on entities (responses, courses, students, etc.), emails sent, and submissions, then saves these statistics to a database. The action is restricted to admin users and handles potential errors during data storage. The statistics cover the hour preceding the current time.
