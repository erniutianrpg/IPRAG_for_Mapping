This code defines a `DeleteInstructorAction` class that handles deleting an instructor from a course via a web API. It checks if the requester is authorized (admin or instructor with modify permissions) and ensures the instructor isn't the last one in the course (which would leave the course without instructors). If valid, it deletes the instructor and returns a success message. The action prevents deletion if there are no remaining instructors with modify privileges or visibility to students.
