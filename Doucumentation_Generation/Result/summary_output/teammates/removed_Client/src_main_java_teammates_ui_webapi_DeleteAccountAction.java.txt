This code defines a `DeleteAccountAction` class that handles the deletion of a user account (student or instructor) in a web API. As an admin-only action, it takes a Google ID as a parameter, cascades the deletion (including associated data) via the `logic.deleteAccountCascade` method, and returns a success message. The entire process is restricted to admin users. (98 words)
