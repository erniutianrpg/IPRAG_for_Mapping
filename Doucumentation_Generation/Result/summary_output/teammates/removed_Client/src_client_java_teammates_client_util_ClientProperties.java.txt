This code defines a `ClientProperties` utility class that loads and stores configuration values from a `client.properties` file. It reads four properties: target URL, API URL, backdoor key, and CSRF key during static initialization. The class also provides a helper method `isTargetUrlDevServer()` to check if the target URL points to a local development server. The properties are loaded once when the class is initialized and are accessible as public static final constants. The class cannot be instantiated (private constructor).
