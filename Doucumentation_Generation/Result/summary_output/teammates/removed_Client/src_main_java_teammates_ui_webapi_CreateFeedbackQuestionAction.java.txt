This code defines a `CreateFeedbackQuestionAction` class that handles the creation of a feedback question in a course. It verifies the instructor's authentication and authorization, validates the request parameters and question details, then creates the question if valid. The created question's data is returned as JSON. Key steps include access control checks, request validation, and question creation with error handling for invalid inputs.
