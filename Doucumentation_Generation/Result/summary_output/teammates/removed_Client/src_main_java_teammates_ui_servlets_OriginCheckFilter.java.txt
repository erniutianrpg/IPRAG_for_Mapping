The `OriginCheckFilter` is a servlet filter that validates HTTP request origins to prevent CSRF attacks. It checks: 1) allowed HTTP methods and headers, 2) CSRF tokens for POST/PUT/DELETE requests, 3) requests from App Engine queues, and 4) HTTP referrer validity. For development servers, it sets CORS headers. Invalid requests are denied with a 403 error. The filter ensures requests originate from trusted sources before processing.
