This Java code is a data migration script that checks and desanitizes sanitized HTML content in `Instructor` entities. It scans `Instructor` objects, identifies sanitized fields (specifically `displayedName`), logs errors if `role` is unsanitized, and desanitizes `displayedName` if needed. The script runs in preview mode by default, tracking scanned, affected, and updated entities. It extends a base migration class and operates remotely when executed.
