This code defines a `GetAccountAction` class that retrieves an account's information. It's an admin-only API endpoint that takes a Google ID as input, fetches the corresponding account details from the database, and returns them as JSON. If the account doesn't exist, it throws an `EntityNotFoundException`. The returned data is wrapped in an `AccountData` object.
