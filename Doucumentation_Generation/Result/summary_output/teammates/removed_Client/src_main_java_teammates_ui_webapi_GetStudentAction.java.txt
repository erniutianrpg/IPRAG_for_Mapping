This code defines a `GetStudentAction` class that retrieves a student's information from a course. It handles three access scenarios: 
1. For instructors (via email), it verifies their permission to view the student.
2. For unregistered students (via registration key), it checks their access.
3. For registered students, it verifies their identity. 

It returns the student's data while hiding sensitive information from non-instructors. Admins get additional details like Google ID. The API enforces strict access control and returns appropriate error messages for unauthorized access or missing students.
