This code is a cron job that sends reminder emails for upcoming feedback sessions. It retrieves sessions needing opening reminders, generates emails for each session, queues them for sending, and marks the sessions as notified. If errors occur, it logs them. The action is restricted to admin users and returns a success message upon completion.
