This code defines a `GetAccountRequestAction` class that retrieves account request information for an instructor. It takes an email and institution as input parameters, fetches the corresponding account request from the database, and returns it as JSON. If no matching account request is found, it throws an `EntityNotFoundException`. This is an admin-only action, accessible only to authorized users. The response wraps the account request data in an `AccountRequestData` output object. (98 words)
