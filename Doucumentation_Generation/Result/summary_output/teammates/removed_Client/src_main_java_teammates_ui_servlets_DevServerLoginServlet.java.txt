This servlet handles login functionality for a development server. The `doGet` method checks if login is enabled and redirects to a login page if needed, or to the requested URL if already logged in. The `doPost` method processes login requests by creating a user authentication cookie with the provided email and redirecting to the desired URL. It includes security measures like preventing HTTP response splitting and checking if dev server login is enabled. The servlet serves a custom HTML login page for development purposes.
