This Java script migrates feedback text questions in a database by setting `recommendedLength` to `null` for all text questions where it's currently 0. It queries text questions, checks if migration is needed (recommendedLength = 0), and updates them by nullifying the field. The script runs in preview mode first (`isPreview` returns true) to verify changes before actual migration.
