This Java code is a data migration script that indexes newly-indexable fields in `FeedbackSession` entities stored in Google's Objectify datastore. It retrieves all `FeedbackSession` entities, marks each as needing migration, and saves them back without modification to trigger automatic indexing of the new fields. The script runs in preview mode (`isPreview() = true`), showing what would be migrated without actually modifying data. The operation can be executed remotely.
