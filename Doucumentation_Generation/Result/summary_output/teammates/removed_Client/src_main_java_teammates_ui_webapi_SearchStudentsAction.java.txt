The `SearchStudentsAction` class is a web API action that searches for students based on a search key. It allows only instructors and admins to access the functionality. Instructors can search students within their courses, while admins can search across the entire system. The results are returned as a list of `StudentData` objects, with additional admin-specific details if applicable. Unauthorized access attempts or invalid parameters result in appropriate error responses.
