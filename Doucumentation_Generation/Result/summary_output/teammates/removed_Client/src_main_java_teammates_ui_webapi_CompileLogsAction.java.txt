This code defines a cron job that compiles application logs with severity `ERROR` from the past 6 minutes and sends them to a support email if any errors are found. It queries logs using specified time range and severity filters, converts them to error log entries, and only sends an email if there are errors to prevent spamming. The action returns a "Successful" status upon completion.
