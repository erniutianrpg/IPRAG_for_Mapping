The `ActionMappingException` class is a custom exception that indicates a controller class failed to instantiate from a given URL. It stores an HTTP status code (typically 404 or 405) and provides a message describing the error. The exception allows retrieval of the status code via `getStatusCode()`. This helps handle URL routing failures in web requests. (59 words)
