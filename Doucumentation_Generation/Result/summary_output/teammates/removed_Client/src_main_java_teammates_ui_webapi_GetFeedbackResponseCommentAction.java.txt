This code handles retrieving feedback response comments in a web API. It checks user access rights (for both students and instructors) to ensure they can view comments for a specific feedback response. If authorized, it fetches and returns the comment data. The code validates parameters, verifies the response exists, and handles different user intents (student/instructor submission). It returns either the comment data or an appropriate error message if the comment/response doesn't exist or access is denied.
