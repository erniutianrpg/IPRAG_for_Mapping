The `CursorIterator` class is a batch-fetching iterator for Google Cloud Datastore queries. It fetches entities in batches of 300 (maximum allowed) to efficiently handle large datasets. It maintains a buffer to store fetched entities and uses cursors to resume fetching from where it left off. The `hasNext()` method triggers batch fetching when the buffer is empty, and `next()` retrieves entities from the buffer. The static `iterate()` method provides an `Iterable` interface for the query results. This approach optimizes memory usage and performance for large queries.
