This code defines a `DeleteCourseAction` class that handles deleting a course in an educational system. It requires the user to be a logged-in instructor with course modification privileges. The action checks permissions, deletes the specified course (and its associated data) using `logic.deleteCourseCascade()`, and returns a success message ("OK"). Access is denied if the user lacks instructor privileges or proper course access.
