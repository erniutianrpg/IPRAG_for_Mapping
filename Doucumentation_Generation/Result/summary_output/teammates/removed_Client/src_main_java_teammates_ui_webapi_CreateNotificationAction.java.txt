This code creates a new notification banner in a system. It's an admin-only action that takes a request containing notification details (start/end timestamps, style, target user, title, and message). It validates the request, builds a notification with a unique UUID, and attempts to create it. If successful, it returns the new notification data; otherwise, it handles invalid parameters or (unlikely) duplicate UUID errors by returning appropriate error responses. The notification has specific visibility times and display properties.
