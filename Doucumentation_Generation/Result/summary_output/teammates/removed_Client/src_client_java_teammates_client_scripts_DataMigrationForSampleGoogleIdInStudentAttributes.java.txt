This Java script removes fake Google IDs from `CourseStudent` entities in a database. It targets sample/test Google IDs (like "alice.b.tmms.sampleData") and replaces them with an empty string. The script operates in preview mode (`isPreview = true`), meaning it won't modify data unless this flag is changed. It queries students with specified sample IDs, checks if migration is needed (always `true` here), and updates their Google IDs to empty strings. The script is part of a data cleanup process for test/sample data.
