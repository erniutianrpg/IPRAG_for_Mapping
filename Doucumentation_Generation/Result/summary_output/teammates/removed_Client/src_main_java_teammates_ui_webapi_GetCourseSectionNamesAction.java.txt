This code defines an API endpoint (`GetCourseSectionNamesAction`) that retrieves section names for a specific course. It requires users to be logged in and verifies their access as instructors for the course. When executed, it fetches the section names for the given course ID and returns them as JSON. If the course doesn't exist, it throws an `EntityNotFoundException`. The endpoint is part of a larger system for managing course data (likely an educational platform).
