This code provides base functionality for feedback submission actions in a web API. It includes methods to:
1. Check instructor visibility of feedback questions
2. Verify access permissions for students/instructors submitting feedback
3. Handle moderation and preview scenarios
4. Validate session openness for submission
5. Retrieve student/instructor data and recipient sections
