The `BackDoor` class provides utility methods to create direct API calls to the back-end, bypassing the UI. It extends `AbstractBackDoor` and implements methods to retrieve configuration values like the API URL, backdoor key, and CSRF key from `ClientProperties`. It follows the singleton pattern with a private constructor and a static `getInstance()` method to ensure a single instance is used. This enables secure, direct back-end access for testing or administrative purposes. (98 words)
