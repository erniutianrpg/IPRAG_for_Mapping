This module serves as the core API and administrative backend for an educational platform (Teammates), handling user management, course operations, feedback sessions, and data processing. It provides a comprehensive web API layer with actions for instructors and students to manage courses, feedback sessions, enrollments, and submissions, while enforcing strict access controls and validation. The module also includes worker actions for email notifications, cron jobs for automated reminders, and data migration/statistics scripts for backend maintenance. Security features like CSRF protection and request filtering are implemented alongside utility classes for logging, health checks, and development server support. The system supports both production and development environments with appropriate configurations and handles various educational workflows including feedback collection, session management, and user account operations.
