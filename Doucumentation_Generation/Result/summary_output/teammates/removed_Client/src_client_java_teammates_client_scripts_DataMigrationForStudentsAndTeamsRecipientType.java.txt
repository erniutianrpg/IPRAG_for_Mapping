This Java script migrates feedback question data by updating recipient types: it changes `STUDENTS` to `STUDENTS_EXCLUDING_SELF` and `TEAMS` to `TEAMS_EXCLUDING_SELF`. It queries all feedback questions, checks if migration is needed based on current recipient type, performs the update if required, and saves the changes. The script runs in preview mode by default (without modifying data). Addresses issue #2488.
