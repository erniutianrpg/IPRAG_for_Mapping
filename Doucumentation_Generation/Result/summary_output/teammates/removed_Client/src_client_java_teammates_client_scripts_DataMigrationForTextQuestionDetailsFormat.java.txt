This Java script migrates old plain-text format feedback questions to JSON format. It specifically targets TEXT-type questions created before multiple question types existed. The script checks if migration is needed by attempting to parse the question text as JSON (failing for old plain-text format). For affected questions, it converts the plain text to a JSON-formatted `FeedbackTextQuestionDetails` object and updates the question text accordingly. The operation can be run in preview mode (`isPreview() = true`) to check which questions would be migrated.
