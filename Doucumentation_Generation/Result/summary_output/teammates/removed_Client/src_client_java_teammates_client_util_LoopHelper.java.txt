The `LoopHelper` class helps track and report loop iterations. It prints a given message at regular intervals (specified by `printCycle`) to show progress. Each call to `recordLoop()` increments a counter and prints the count and message when the count reaches a multiple of `printCycle`. The current count can be retrieved via `getCount()`. Useful for monitoring long-running loops. (98 words)
