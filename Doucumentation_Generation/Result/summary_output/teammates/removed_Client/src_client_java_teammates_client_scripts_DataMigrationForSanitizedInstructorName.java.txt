This Java script migrates `Instructor` entities by desanitizing their names if they were previously sanitized. It scans all `Instructor` entities, checks if their names contain sanitized HTML, and updates them by desanitizing the names. The script runs in preview mode by default, tracking scanned, affected, and updated entities. It extends a base migration class and uses Objectify for datastore operations. The main method triggers the migration process remotely.
