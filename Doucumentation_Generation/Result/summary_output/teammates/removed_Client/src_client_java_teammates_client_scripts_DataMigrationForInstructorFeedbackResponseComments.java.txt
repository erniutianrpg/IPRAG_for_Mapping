This Java code is a data migration script that updates `FeedbackResponseComment` entities in a database. It sets the `commentGiverType` field to `INSTRUCTORS` and `isCommentFromFeedbackParticipant` to `false` for all instructor comments where `commentGiverType` is null. The script includes preview mode and uses reflection to check field values before migration. It operates on Google Objectify entities and saves changes deferred.
