The `BibField` class is a Java record that represents a bibliographic field with a name (`Field`) and priority (`FieldPriority`). It provides equality comparison based on case-insensitive field names, a hash code derived from the field name, a string representation, and natural ordering by field name. The class implements `Comparable<BibField>` for sorting purposes. (94 words)
