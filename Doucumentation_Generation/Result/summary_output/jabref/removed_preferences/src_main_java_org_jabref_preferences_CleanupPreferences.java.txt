The `CleanupPreferences` class manages cleanup operations for bibliographic entries in JabRef. It maintains a set of active cleanup jobs (like DOI cleanup, PDF renaming, etc.) as an observable set and provides methods to activate/deactivate them. It also handles field formatter cleanups through a property-based mechanism. The class offers functionality to check, set, and modify active cleanup steps and formatters, supporting operations like converting entry formats, fixing file links, and cleaning up specific fields.
