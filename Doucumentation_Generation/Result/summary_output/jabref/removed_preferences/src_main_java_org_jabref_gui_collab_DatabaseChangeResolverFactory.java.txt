This code defines a `DatabaseChangeResolverFactory` class that creates appropriate resolvers for different types of database changes in JabRef. Currently, it only handles `EntryChange` by creating an `EntryChangeResolver` with the provided dependencies (`dialogService`, `databaseContext`, and `bibEntryPreferences`). For other change types, it returns an empty `Optional`. The factory pattern centralizes resolver creation logic. (98 words)
