This code provides functionality to visually sort text ranges in a document (top-down, left-to-right) using OpenOffice/LibreOffice's API. The `visualSort` method takes a list of `RangeSortable` objects and sorts them based on their on-screen positions obtained via `XTextViewCursor`. It handles coordinates relative to the document's first page and compares positions vertically first, then horizontally. The sorting may not match reading order in multi-column or side-by-side page layouts. The class uses a helper `ComparableMark` to store and compare positions during sorting.
