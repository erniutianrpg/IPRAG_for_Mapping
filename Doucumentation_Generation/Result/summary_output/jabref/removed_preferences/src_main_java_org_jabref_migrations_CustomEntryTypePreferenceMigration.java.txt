This code migrates custom BibTeX entry type preferences from an old format to a new repository-based system in JabRef. It reads stored custom entry types (including their required, optional, and important fields) from deprecated preference keys, converts them to `BibEntryType` objects, and stores them in the new entry types manager. The migration handles both old-style preferences (without prioritized optional fields) and newer ones (with prioritized fields). The upgrade is performed for all stored custom types sequentially until no more are found.
