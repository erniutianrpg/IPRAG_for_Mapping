The `RemoteListenerServerManager` class manages the lifecycle of a `RemoteListenerServerThread` for handling remote messages. It provides methods to `open` (initialize), `start`, and `stop` the server thread, with error handling for port binding. The `openAndStart` method combines initialization and starting. It checks the server's state (`isOpen`, `isNotStartedBefore`) and ensures proper resource cleanup via `AutoCloseable`. The server runs in a dedicated thread managed by `JabRefExecutorService`.
