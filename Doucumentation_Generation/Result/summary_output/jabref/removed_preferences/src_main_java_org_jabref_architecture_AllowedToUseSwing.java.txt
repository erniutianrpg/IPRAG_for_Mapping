This code defines a custom annotation `@AllowedToUseSwing` used to mark logic classes that are permitted to access Swing components. The annotation includes a mandatory `value()` field to specify the rationale for why Swing access is allowed, ensuring proper documentation of the exception. This helps maintain architectural boundaries in the application.
