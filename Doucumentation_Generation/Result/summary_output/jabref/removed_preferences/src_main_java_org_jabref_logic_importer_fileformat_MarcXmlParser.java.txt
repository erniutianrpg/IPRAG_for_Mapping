The `MarcXmlParser` class is a Java parser for MARC XML format (specifically the Bavarian variant) that converts bibliographic records into `BibEntry` objects. It processes XML input, extracts metadata like ISBN, authors, titles, publication details, and other fields, and maps them to corresponding fields in a bibliography entry. The parser handles various MARC tags (e.g., 020 for ISBN, 245 for title) and subfields, supporting features like author lists, electronic resources (URLs/DOIs), and notes. It logs unparsed tags and malformed data while constructing structured bibliographic entries.
