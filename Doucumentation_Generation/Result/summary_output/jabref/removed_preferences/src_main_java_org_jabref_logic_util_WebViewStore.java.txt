The `WebViewStore` class manages a pool of JavaFX `WebView` instances to prevent UI freezes during their creation. It preloads a configurable number of `WebView` instances at startup (default: 4) and maintains a minimum threshold (default: 2). When a `WebView` is requested via `get()`, it returns a preloaded instance if available or creates a new one. The store dynamically adds new instances in the background when the pool size falls below the minimum threshold. Initialization is required at application startup.
