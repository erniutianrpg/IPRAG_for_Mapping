The `TelemetryPreferences` class manages user preferences for telemetry data collection in a JavaFX application. It stores three properties as observable values: whether to collect telemetry (`collectTelemetry`), whether to ask for consent (`askToCollectTelemetry`), and a user ID (`userId`). The class provides getter/setter methods for each property and exposes them as JavaFX properties for binding. This allows the UI to automatically update when preferences change. (98 words)
