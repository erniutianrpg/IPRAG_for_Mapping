The `DBMSConnectionProperties` class manages database connection properties for establishing connections to a DBMS. It stores details like host, port, database name, user credentials, SSL settings, and timezone. The class can initialize these properties from preferences (including decrypting passwords) or via constructor parameters. It provides getters for all properties, generates connection URLs, converts properties to a `Properties` object, and includes methods for validation and equality comparison (excluding password). The class serves as a container for all necessary database connection configuration.
