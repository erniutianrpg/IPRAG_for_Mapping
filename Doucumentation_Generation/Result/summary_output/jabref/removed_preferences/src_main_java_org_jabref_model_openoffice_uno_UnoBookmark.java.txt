This Java code provides utility methods for managing bookmarks in LibreOffice/OpenOffice documents via UNO API. Key functionalities include:  
1. Getting bookmark access by name (`getNameAccess`)  
2. Retrieving a bookmark's text range (`getAnchor`)  
3. Creating bookmarks with automatic name conflict resolution (`create`)  
4. Removing existing bookmarks (`removeIfExists`).  

It handles document exceptions and wraps UNO API operations for easier bookmark manipulation in text documents.
