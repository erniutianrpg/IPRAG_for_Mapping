The `StringManipulator` class provides text manipulation utilities for changing word casing (uppercase, lowercase, capitalize) and deleting words (forward/backward) relative to a cursor position. It uses helper methods to find word boundaries and applies formatters for case changes. Each operation returns the modified string and updated cursor position in a `ResultingStringState` object. The class supports operations in both forward and backward directions.
