This code defines a custom annotation `@AllowedToUseLogic` in Java. The annotation serves as a marker to indicate that a particular logic class is permitted to be used within the model package. It includes a mandatory `value()` field to provide a rationale or justification for why the class is allowed this access. The annotation helps enforce architectural boundaries between packages.
