The `DublinCoreExtractor` class facilitates bidirectional conversion between BibTeX entries and Dublin Core metadata. It extracts BibTeX fields (author, title, etc.) from Dublin Core schema (like creator, description) and vice versa. The class handles standard field mappings, custom fields via Dublin Core's relation attribute, and respects privacy filters. Key methods include `extractBibtexEntry()` for Dublin Core to BibTeX conversion and `fillDublinCoreSchema()` for BibTeX to Dublin Core conversion. Special cases like dates, keywords, and custom fields are managed with appropriate formatting and parsing.
