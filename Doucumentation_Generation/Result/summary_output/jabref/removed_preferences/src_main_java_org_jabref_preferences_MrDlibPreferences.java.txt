The `MrDlibPreferences` class manages user preferences for the Mr.DLib service in JabRef. It stores and provides access to four boolean settings: whether to accept recommendations, and whether to send language, OS, and timezone information. Each preference has getter, setter, and property accessor methods, using JavaFX properties for observable values. The class encapsulates these preferences with default values set via constructor parameters. (98 words)
