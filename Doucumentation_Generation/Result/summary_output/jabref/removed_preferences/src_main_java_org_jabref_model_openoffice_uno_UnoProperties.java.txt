This code provides utility methods for working with OpenOffice/LibreOffice UNO (Universal Network Objects) properties. It includes methods to: 
1. Convert property containers to property sets
2. Retrieve property set information and names 
3. Get property values as objects 
4. Handle property-related exceptions 

The class operates on UNO interfaces like `XPropertySet`, `XPropertyContainer`, and `XPropertySetInfo`, providing null-safe operations through Java's `Optional` and stream processing. It simplifies working with UNO properties in OpenOffice/LibreOffice extensions.
