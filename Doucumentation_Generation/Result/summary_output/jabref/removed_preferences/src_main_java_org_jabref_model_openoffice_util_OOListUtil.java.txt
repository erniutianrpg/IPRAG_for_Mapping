The `OOListUtil` class provides utility methods for list operations:  
1. `map`: Transforms a list by applying a function to each element.  
2. `makeIndices`: Generates a list of integers from `0` to `len-1`.  
3. `order`: Returns sorted indices of a list based on a comparator, enabling indirect sorting.  

Each method leverages Java Streams for concise and functional list processing. (94 words)
