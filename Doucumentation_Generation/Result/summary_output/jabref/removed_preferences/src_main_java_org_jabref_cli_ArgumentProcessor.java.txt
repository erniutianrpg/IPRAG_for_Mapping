The `ArgumentProcessor` class handles command-line arguments for JabRef, a reference management software. It processes various commands like importing/exporting files, fetching entries from online sources, generating citation keys, setting file links, and managing preferences. The class parses arguments, performs corresponding operations (e.g., file I/O, database manipulation), and returns results. Key functionalities include importing bibliographic data, exporting in different formats, searching databases, and modifying PDF metadata. It also manages GUI-related flags and preference settings. The class serves as the main CLI interface for JabRef's non-interactive operations.
