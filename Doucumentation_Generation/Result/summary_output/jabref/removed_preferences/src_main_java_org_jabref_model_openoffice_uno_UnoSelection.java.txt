This code provides utility methods for working with selections in an OpenOffice/LibreOffice text document using UNO API. It offers two main functions: 

1. `getSelectionAsXServiceInfo`: Retrieves the current selection as an `XServiceInfo` object to identify the selected element type (text, frame, image, etc.), returning `Optional.empty()` if unavailable. 

2. `select`: Sets a new selection in the document. 

Both methods use `getSelectionSupplier` internally to obtain the document's selection supplier, handling null checks and logging warnings for failures. The code helps manage document selections programmatically. (98 words)
