This code provides utility methods to access and manage styles (character and paragraph) in an OpenOffice/LibreOffice text document via UNO API. It includes methods to:
1. Retrieve styles by name from specified style families (character or paragraph)
2. Get the internal names of styles
3. Handle exceptions for invalid style names or families
The main functionality revolves around querying and casting style objects from the document's style families using the UNO (Universal Network Objects) API.
