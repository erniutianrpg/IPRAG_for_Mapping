The `CitaviXmlImporter` class is a Java importer for the Citavi XML reference management format. It extends `Importer` and implements `Parser` to convert Citavi XML files (often in ZIP format) into BibTeX entries. Key functionalities include:

1. Recognizes Citavi XML files by checking for "citaviexchangedata" in the file header.
2. Parses XML data using JAXB to extract references, authors, editors, keywords, and publishers.
3. Converts Citavi reference types to BibTeX entry types (e.g., books, articles).
4. Handles metadata like titles, abstracts, DOIs, and pages, cleaning and formatting text (e.g., HTML to LaTeX).
5. Processes nested data like knowledge items (comments, highlights) and quotation types.

The importer outputs a list of `BibEntry` objects compatible with JabRef's database.
