This code handles remote command-line arguments for JabRef, a reference management software. It processes the arguments using an `ArgumentProcessor` in remote mode, then adds the parsed results to JabRef's main GUI. The results are added to the JavaFX application thread via `Platform.runLater()`, with the first result focusing the panel. Errors during parsing are logged. The class implements `RemoteMessageHandler` and uses dependency injection for preferences.
