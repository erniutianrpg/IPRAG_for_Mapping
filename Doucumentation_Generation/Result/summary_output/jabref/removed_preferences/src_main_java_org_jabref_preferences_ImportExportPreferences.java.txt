The `ImportExportPreferences` class manages import/export settings for JabRef, including auto-save behavior, file reformatting, working directories, export extensions, save order, and duplicate warnings. It uses JavaFX properties to store and observe these preferences, providing getter/setter methods for each property. Key features include controlling auto-save, reformatting on save, import/export paths, last used export extension, and duplicate detection during imports.
