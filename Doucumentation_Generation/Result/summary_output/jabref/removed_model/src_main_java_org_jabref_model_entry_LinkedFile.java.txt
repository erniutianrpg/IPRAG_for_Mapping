The `LinkedFile` class represents an external file link (e.g., PDF) associated with a bibliographic entry in JabRef. It stores file metadata (description, path/URL, type) and provides methods to manage and validate these properties. Key features include serialization support for drag-and-drop, URL detection, file path resolution relative to directories, and observability for GUI updates. The class ensures proper path handling (converting backslashes, checking online links) and offers methods to locate files in specified directories.
