This code defines a comparator (`CompareCitedKey`) for sorting citation keys in a bibliography. It compares two `ComparableCitedKey` objects by: 
1. Handling unresolved citations (empty BibEntry) by either placing them first or last based on `unresolvedComesFirst`
2. Comparing unresolved entries by their citation keys
3. Using a provided `BibEntry` comparator for resolved entries. 

The class helps organize citations while accounting for unresolved references. (94 words)
