The code defines an enum `EntriesEventSource` that specifies the context from which entries events are triggered. It includes five possible sources: `LOCAL` (local changes), `SHARED` (shared changes), `UNDO` (undo actions), `CLEANUP_TIMESTAMP` (timestamp cleanup), and `SAVE_ACTION` (save operations). This enum helps identify the origin of events in the application. (49 words)
