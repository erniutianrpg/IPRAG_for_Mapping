The `EntryType` interface defines a contract for entry types in JabRef, requiring implementing classes to provide two methods: `getName()`, which returns the tag name of the entry type, and `getDisplayName()`, which returns the user-friendly display name. This interface serves as a base for different bibliographic entry types (like articles, books) in the JabRef reference manager. (58 words)
