This code migrates legacy explicit groups in a bibliography database from an old format (where groups store entry lists) to a new format (where entries store group memberships). It scans all groups, identifies legacy `ExplicitGroup` instances with old-style entry keys, and converts them by moving the group assignments to the entries themselves. Finally, it clears the legacy keys from the groups. The migration operates on the database metadata after opening a file.
