The `NotMatcher` class is a decorator that inverts the result of another `SearchMatcher`. When checking if a `BibEntry` matches, it returns the logical negation of the wrapped matcher's result (e.g., `true` becomes `false` and vice versa). This allows for negating search conditions. The class enforces non-null initialization of the underlying matcher. (Words: 50)
