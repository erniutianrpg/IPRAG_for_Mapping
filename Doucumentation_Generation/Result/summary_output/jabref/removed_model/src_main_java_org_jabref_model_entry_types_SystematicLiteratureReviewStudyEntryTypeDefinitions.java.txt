This code defines three entry types for a systematic literature review study definition file: `STUDY_ENTRY` (study metadata with required fields like author and name), `SEARCH_QUERY_ENTRY` (search queries with a required query field), and `LIBRARY_ENTRY` (targeted libraries with required name and enabled fields). These entry types are collected in a list `ALL` for reference. The class provides structured definitions for study-related data in a systematic review context.
