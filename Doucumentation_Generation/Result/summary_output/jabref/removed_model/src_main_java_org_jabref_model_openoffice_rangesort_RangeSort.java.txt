The `RangeSort` class provides functionality to sort and partition text ranges in OpenOffice documents. It groups ranges (`RangeHolder`) by their parent text (`XText`), then sorts them within each group based on their start/end positions using `XTextRangeCompare`. Key methods include `sortWithinPartition` for sorting ranges in the same text, `partitionRanges` for grouping by text, and `partitionAndSortRanges` for both grouping and sorting. The sorting is based on range positions, not equality.
