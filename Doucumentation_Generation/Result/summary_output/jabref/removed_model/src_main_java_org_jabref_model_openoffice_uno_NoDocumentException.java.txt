The `NoDocumentException` class is a custom exception in Java that signals when there's no document connected. It extends `Exception` and provides two constructors: one with a custom error message and another with a default message ("Not connected to a document"). This exception is likely used to handle cases where a document operation is attempted without an active document connection. (50 words)
