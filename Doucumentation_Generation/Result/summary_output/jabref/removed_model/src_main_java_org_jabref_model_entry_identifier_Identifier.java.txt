This Java interface `Identifier` defines a standard structure for identifier objects in JabRef. It requires implementing classes to provide: 
1. A normalized string representation of the identifier (`getNormalized()`)
2. The default bibliographic field associated with the identifier (`getDefaultField()`)
3. An optional external URI for the identifier (`getExternalURI()`). 
It serves as a base for different types of bibliographic identifiers (like DOI, ISBN, etc.) with consistent methods for access and external linking. (98 words)
