The `EnglishStemAnalyzer` class is a custom Lucene analyzer that processes text by: 1) tokenizing input using `StandardTokenizer`, 2) converting tokens to lowercase, 3) removing English stop words, 4) normalizing digits with `DecimalDigitFilter`, and 5) applying Porter stemming to reduce words to their root forms. This prepares text for efficient indexing and searching.
