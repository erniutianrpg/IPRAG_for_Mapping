The `OrMatcher` class is a matcher set that checks if any of its contained matchers match a given `BibEntry`. It extends `MatcherSet` and overrides `isMatch()` to return `true` if at least one matcher in the set matches the entry, using `ListUtil.anyMatch()` for evaluation. Essentially, it performs a logical OR operation across all matchers. (58 words)
