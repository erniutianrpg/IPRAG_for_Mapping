The `UnoCast` class provides a utility method `cast` that simplifies UNO interface casting in OpenOffice/StarOffice APIs. It wraps `UnoRuntime.queryInterface()` in an `Optional`, returning either the cast interface if available or `Optional.empty()` if not. This avoids null checks and provides a cleaner way to handle potential casting failures in UNO (Universal Network Objects) programming. The method is generic, accepting any interface type and an object to cast. The class is not meant to be instantiated (private constructor).
