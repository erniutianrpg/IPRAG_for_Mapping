The `SearchGroup` class in JabRef represents a group of bibliography entries that match a complex search pattern. It extends `AbstractGroup` and uses `GroupSearchQuery` to check if entries match the search expression with specified flags. Key functionalities include: matching entries via `contains()`, equality checks, deep copying, and dynamic group identification. The search expression and flags can be retrieved, and the class provides proper `toString()`, `equals()`, and `hashCode()` implementations.
