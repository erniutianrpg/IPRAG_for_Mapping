This code provides a canonical string representation of a BibTeX entry in JabRef, including all fields (even internal ones) except the citation key, which is handled separately. It preserves special characters and newlines without escaping, sorts fields alphabetically (case-insensitive), and adds JabRef-specific shared data. The output resembles BibTeX format but isn't fully BibTeX-compliant (e.g., doesn't handle string constants or escaping). The representation starts with `@type{key,` followed by sorted fields in `field = {value}` format, and ends with `}`.
