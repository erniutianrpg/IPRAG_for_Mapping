The `Study` class represents a scientific study's metadata, including authors, title, research questions, search queries, and databases. It serves as a data model for YAML file parsing (via `StudyYamlParser`) using Jackson annotations for JSON/YAML serialization/deserialization. The class provides getters/setters for all fields and implements `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` methods for proper object comparison and representation. It ignores unknown YAML properties during parsing.
