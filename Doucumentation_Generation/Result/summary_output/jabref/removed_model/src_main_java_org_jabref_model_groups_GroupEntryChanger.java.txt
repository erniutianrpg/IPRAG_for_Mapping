The `GroupEntryChanger` interface defines methods for adding and removing `BibEntry` entries to/from a group in JabRef, returning a list of changes (`FieldChange`) made. It includes two main methods: `add()` for adding entries (with an overload for single entries) and `remove()` for removing entries (also with an overload for single entries). These methods track modifications to the group or entries, providing a way to monitor changes. The interface supports bulk operations via collections and convenience methods for single entries.
