The `CitationGroup` class manages a group of citations in a document, storing their type, order, and metadata. It provides methods to sort citations locally using a comparator, maintain global ordering indices, and handle reference marks for linking. The class also stores citation markers and page info, with special handling for the JabRef52 data model where page info is kept in the last citation. Key functionalities include maintaining citation order, setting/getting markers, and managing cross-references.
