The `AutomaticPersonsGroup` class in JabRef creates subgroups of BibTeX entries based on the last names of authors/editors in a specified field. It extends `AutomaticGroup` and overrides methods to generate subgroups (`GroupTreeNode`) for each distinct last name found in the field. The class includes standard methods like `equals`, `hashCode`, and `deepCopy`, and provides access to the field used for grouping via `getField()`. Essentially, it automatically organizes entries by person last names from a given field. (98 words)
