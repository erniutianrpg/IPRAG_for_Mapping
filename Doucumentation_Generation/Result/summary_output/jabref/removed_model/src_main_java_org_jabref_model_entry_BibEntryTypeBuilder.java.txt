The `BibEntryTypeBuilder` class is a builder pattern implementation for creating `BibEntryType` objects in JabRef. It allows configuring an entry type (default: Misc), fields with priorities (IMPORTANT or DETAIL), and required fields. The builder provides fluent methods to add fields with different priorities and mark fields as required. When built, it combines all fields, treating required fields as IMPORTANT, and creates a `BibEntryType` with the specified configuration.
