This code defines an abstract `EntriesEvent` class that extends `BibDatabaseContextChangedEvent`, representing events involving BibTeX entries. It stores a list of affected `BibEntry` objects and an event source location (defaulting to LOCAL). The class provides getters for these fields and ensures non-null values via `Objects.requireNonNull()`. It serves as a base class for specific entry-related events in a bibliography database system.
