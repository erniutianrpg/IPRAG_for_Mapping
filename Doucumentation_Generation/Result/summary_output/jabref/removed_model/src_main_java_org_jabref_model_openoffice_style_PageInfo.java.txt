This code provides utility methods for handling page information (pageInfo) in a document. The `normalizePageInfo` method cleans and trims input text, returning `Optional.empty()` for null, empty, or whitespace-only strings. The `comparePageInfo` method compares two pageInfo strings, treating empty optionals as coming before non-empty ones, and compares the normalized strings lexicographically. Both methods work with `OOText` objects wrapped in `Optional`.
