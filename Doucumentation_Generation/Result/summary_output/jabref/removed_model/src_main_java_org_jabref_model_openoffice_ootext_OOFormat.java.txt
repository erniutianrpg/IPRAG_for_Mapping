The `OOFormat` class provides helper methods to generate OpenOffice (OO) text markup for formatting text in citations and bibliographies. It includes functions to:  
1. Set character locale (language/country) or mark text as language-neutral (`zxx`)  
2. Apply character styles  
3. Format text as paragraphs with optional style names  
4. Create cross-references to page numbers of reference marks  

Each method wraps input text in appropriate OO markup tags. The class is utility-focused with no instance methods.
