This code defines a `Date` class for handling various date formats in the JabRef reference manager. It supports parsing dates from strings in multiple formats (ISO, localized, etc.), converting between date components (year, month, day), and normalizing dates to a standard format. The class uses Java's `TemporalAccessor` for flexible date representation, handles date ranges (e.g., "2010/2015"), and provides utility methods for date manipulation and comparison. Error handling for invalid formats is included, with logging for debugging.
