The `BibDatabase` class represents a bibliography database (like a BibTeX file) that manages BibTeX entries and strings. Key functionalities include:

- Storing and managing BibTeX entries (insert, remove, retrieve by ID/citation key)
- Handling BibTeX strings (add, remove, resolve references)
- Supporting preamble and epilog text sections
- Event handling for database changes (entry added/removed/modified)
- String resolution (replacing string references with their values)
- Shared database identification support
- Citation key management (checking for duplicates)
- Maintaining line separator preferences

The class provides thread-safe operations and uses an event bus to notify listeners about changes to the database content.
