This code provides utility methods for managing bookmarks in a LibreOffice/OpenOffice text document via UNO API. Key functionalities include: 
1. Accessing bookmarks by name (`getNameAccess`), 
2. Retrieving a bookmark's text range (`getAnchor`), 
3. Creating bookmarks with automatic name conflict resolution (`create`), and 
4. Removing existing bookmarks (`removeIfExists`). 
It handles document disposal and missing elements gracefully, returning Optional where appropriate. The methods work with the document's XTextDocument interface and XTextRange for bookmark positioning.
