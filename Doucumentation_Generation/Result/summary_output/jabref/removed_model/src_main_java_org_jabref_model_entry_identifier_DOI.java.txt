This code defines a `DOI` class for handling Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) and Short DOIs in Java. It provides functionality to:

1. Validate and parse DOIs from various formats (URLs, URNs, plain text)
2. Extract DOIs from text strings
3. Convert DOIs to URI representations
4. Handle both regular DOIs (10.xxxx) and Short DOIs (10/xxxx)
5. Normalize and compare DOIs case-insensitively
6. Clean and decode DOI strings (removing whitespace, non-ASCII chars, LaTeX formatting)

The class uses regex patterns to match DOI formats and provides methods to check validity, parse, and format DOIs consistently.
