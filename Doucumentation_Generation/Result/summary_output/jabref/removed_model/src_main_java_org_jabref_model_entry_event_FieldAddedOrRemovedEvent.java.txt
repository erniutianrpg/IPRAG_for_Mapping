The `FieldAddedOrRemovedEvent` class extends `FieldChangedEvent` and represents an event triggered when a field is either added or removed in a BibTeX entry. It inherits functionality from its parent class, which includes tracking the field change and the event source. The constructor simply passes these parameters to the superclass. This event is likely part of a larger event-handling system in JabRef for tracking changes to bibliographic entries. (72 words)
