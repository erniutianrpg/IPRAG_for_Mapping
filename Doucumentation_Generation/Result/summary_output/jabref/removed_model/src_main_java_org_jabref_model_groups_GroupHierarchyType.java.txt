This code defines an enum `GroupHierarchyType` that represents three types of group hierarchies in JabRef:  
1. `INDEPENDENT` - Group content is unaffected by its position in the hierarchy.  
2. `REFINING` - Group content is the intersection of its own and its supergroup's content.  
3. `INCLUDING` - Group content is the union of its own and its subgroups' content.  

It includes methods to get a type by its ordinal number (defaulting to `INDEPENDENT` if invalid) and to retrieve the display name of each type. (98 words)
