This code defines IEEEtran-specific BibTeX entry types for JabRef, a reference management software. It creates five entry types (Electronic, IEEEtranBSTCTL, Periodical, Patent, Standard) with their required and optional fields using `BibEntryTypeBuilder`. Each type is configured with relevant metadata fields (like author, title, URL) and then collected into a final `ALL` list. The class serves as a static definition container for IEEEtran bibliography style support.
