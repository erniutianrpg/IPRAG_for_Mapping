The `ArXivIdentifier` class represents and validates arXiv identifiers, which are used for academic papers. It parses input strings to extract the identifier, version, and classification (if present), supports normalization (with/without version), and provides URI generation for arXiv links. The class includes methods for equality checks, hash code generation, and optional classification retrieval. It handles both modern (numeric) and older (alphanumeric) arXiv identifier formats.
