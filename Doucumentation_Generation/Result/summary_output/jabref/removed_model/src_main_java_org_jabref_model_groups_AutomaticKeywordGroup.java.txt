The `AutomaticKeywordGroup` class in JabRef creates hierarchical groups from keywords in BibTeX entries. It splits keywords using a delimiter and organizes them hierarchically with another delimiter. Each keyword becomes a group, with child groups formed from hierarchical sub-keywords. The class supports group creation, copying, equality checks, and subgroup generation from BibEntry fields. It's used for automatically organizing references based on keyword hierarchies.
