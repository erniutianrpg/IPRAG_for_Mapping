The `FieldFactory` class provides utility methods for handling bibliographic fields in JabRef. It includes functionality to:
1. Serialize/deserialize field lists using separators ("/" for fallback fields, ";" for lists)
2. Parse field names into field objects from various sources (Standard, Special, IEEE fields etc.)
3. Get predefined field sets (identifiers, journal names, person names etc.)
4. Check field properties (internal fields, multi-line fields)
5. Provide default field collections for display and processing

The class serves as a central hub for field-related operations, supporting different field types and formats used in bibliographic data management.
