The `IdGenerator` class generates unique 8-digit numeric IDs in a thread-safe manner. It uses a static counter (`idCounter`) and a synchronized `next()` method to ensure thread safety. Each call to `next()` returns a zero-padded 8-digit string (e.g., "00000001") and increments the counter. The IDs start at "00000000" and increase sequentially. The class prevents instantiation with a private constructor.
