The `Citation` class represents a bibliographic citation in JabRef, storing metadata like citation keys, database lookup results, numeric identifiers, unique letters, page info, and first appearance flags. It provides methods to look up entries in BibTeX databases, manage citation attributes, and validate page info normalization. The class implements interfaces for different citation styles (author-year and numeric) and supports comparison operations.
