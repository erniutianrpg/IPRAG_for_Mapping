This code defines a Java class `SearchFieldConstants` that stores constant string values used for PDF search functionality. It includes field names like `PATH`, `CONTENT`, `PAGE_NUMBER`, `ANNOTATIONS`, and `MODIFIED`, which are grouped in the `PDF_FIELDS` array. The `VERSION` constant specifies the Lucene search version (`lucene95`). These constants are likely used as field identifiers for indexing and searching PDF documents in a search engine.
