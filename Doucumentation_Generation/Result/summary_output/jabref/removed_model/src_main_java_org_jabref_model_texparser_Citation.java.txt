The `Citation` class represents a citation in a LaTeX document, storing its file path, line number, column start/end positions, and the line's text. It includes validation in the constructor and provides getters for these fields. The `getContext()` method returns a fixed-width (300 chars) snippet of the citation with surrounding text, adding ellipses if truncated. It also overrides `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` for proper object comparison and string representation. This class is typically used for tracking and displaying citation locations in LaTeX parsing.
