The `CitationLookupResult` class stores a `BibEntry` (bibliography entry) and its associated `BibDatabase` (database). It ensures non-null values in the constructor and provides `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods for comparison, checking if both the entry and database match. The equality check relies on `BibEntry.equals()` and reference comparison for `BibDatabase`. This class is used to manage citations and verify if they refer to the same source.
