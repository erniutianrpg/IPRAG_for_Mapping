The `OOListUtil` class provides utility methods for list operations:  
1. `map`: Transforms a list using a given function.  
2. `makeIndices`: Generates a list of integers from 0 to (len-1).  
3. `order`: Returns sorted indices of a list based on a comparator, allowing indirect sorting.  

These methods simplify common list manipulations, such as mapping elements, generating index ranges, and obtaining sorted indices without modifying the original list.
