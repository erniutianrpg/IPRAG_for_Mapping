This code checks for overlaps between text ranges in a LibreOffice/OpenOffice document. It compares two lists of text range holders (`fewHolders` and `manyHolders`) and returns the first detected overlap (if any) along with its type (EQUAL_RANGE, TOUCH, or OVERLAP). The comparison considers whether ranges are touching or exactly equal, with an option to include/exclude touching ranges. The implementation minimizes calls to LibreOffice APIs by caching text range information. The result is returned as a list of `RangeOverlap` objects containing the overlap kind and involved ranges.
