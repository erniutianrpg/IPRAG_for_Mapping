The `UnicodeToReadableCharMap` class extends `HashMap` to map Unicode characters to their readable Latin alphabet equivalents. For example, it converts "Ä" to "Ae", "ö" to "oe", and "ß" to "ss". This facilitates text processing by replacing special or accented characters with simpler, more common representations. The mappings cover a wide range of Unicode characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters from various European languages.
