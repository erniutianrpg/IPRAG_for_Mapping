The `CitedKeys` class manages citation keys and their associated data in a bibliography context. It maintains an order-preserving map of citation keys (`CitedKey` objects) and provides methods to: retrieve values, sort entries using a comparator, number keys in order, look up keys in databases, and distribute lookup results, numbers, and unique letters to citation groups. The class ensures unresolved citations remain unnumbered while preserving order during operations.
