The `CitationEntry` class represents a citation entry with a reference mark name, optional page information, and context. It provides constructors for creating entries with or without page info, getter methods for accessing fields, and implements `Comparable` to sort entries by reference mark name. It also overrides `equals()` and `hashCode()` to compare entries based solely on the reference mark name. The class is part of a bibliography management system for OpenOffice. (98 words)
