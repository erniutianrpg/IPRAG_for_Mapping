The `BibEntryType` class represents a bibliographic entry type (like article, book) with its associated fields. It stores mandatory fields (`requiredFields`) and all fields (`fields`), providing methods to access optional, required, primary/secondary, and deprecated fields. The class supports comparison, equality checks, and conversion between BibTeX and BibLaTeX field formats. It's essentially a metadata container for different types of bibliographic entries, helping manage field requirements and priorities.
