This code detects whether a BibTeX database is in BibTeX or BibLaTeX format by checking entry types. It examines all entries in the database; if any entry type is exclusive to BibLaTeX (case-insensitive check), it returns BibLaTeX mode. Otherwise, it defaults to BibTeX mode. The decision is based solely on standard entry types.
