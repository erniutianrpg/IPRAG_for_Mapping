This code defines an enum `BiblatexSoftwareField` that implements the `Field` interface, representing specific fields for BibLaTeX software entries. It includes fields like `HALID`, `LICENSE`, and `REPOSITORY`, each with a name, optional display name, and properties. The class provides constructors to initialize these attributes and methods to access them. The `fromName` method allows looking up a field by name, checking against a `BiblatexSoftwareEntryType`. The class also overrides standard `Field` methods to handle properties, names, and display names.
