The `TreeCollector` class is a Java `Collector` that merges a list of tree nodes into a hierarchical tree structure. It uses three key functions: `getChildren` to retrieve child nodes, `addChild` to add nodes to parents, and `equivalence` to determine node equality. The collector processes nodes, merging duplicates and their children while preserving the tree structure. The result is an `ObservableList` representing the forest of merged trees. This is useful for transforming flat node lists into structured hierarchies (e.g., converting `{A > A1, A > A2, B}` into `{A > {A1, A2}, B}`).
