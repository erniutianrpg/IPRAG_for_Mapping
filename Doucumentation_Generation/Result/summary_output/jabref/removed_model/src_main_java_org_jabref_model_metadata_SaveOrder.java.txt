The `SaveOrder` class manages the sorting configuration for saving entries in JabRef. It supports three order types: SPECIFIED (custom field-based sorting), ORIGINAL (original entry order), and TABLE (table-based order). The class stores sorting criteria as field-ascending/descending pairs and provides methods to parse, convert, and compare these configurations. The nested `SortCriterion` class defines individual sorting rules. Key functionality includes parsing from string lists, default order creation, and converting configurations back to string representations for storage.
