The `OptionalUtil` class provides utility methods for working with Java `Optional` objects. Key functionalities include: converting `Optional` to `List` or `Stream`, comparing two `Optional` values with a custom predicate, combining two `Optional` values, checking conditions on `Optional` contents, and providing fallback values. These helper methods simplify common operations like null-safe conversions, conditional checks, and value combinations when working with `Optional` types.
