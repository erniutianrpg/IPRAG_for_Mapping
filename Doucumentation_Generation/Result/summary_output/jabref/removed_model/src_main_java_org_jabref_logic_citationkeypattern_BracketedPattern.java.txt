This code provides functionality for generating citation keys from BibTeX entries using customizable patterns. Key features include:

1. Expands bracketed patterns like `[year]_[author]` into citation keys using entry metadata
2. Handles various field types including authors, editors, titles, pages, and keywords
3. Supports modifiers for formatting (e.g., abbreviating, lowercasing)
4. Processes author lists with multiple formatting options (initials, last names, etc.)
5. Generates institution keys from organization names
6. Includes special handling for edge cases like empty fields or complex author lists

The main class `BracketedPattern` takes a pattern string and expands it using data from a `BibEntry`, with support for fallbacks and database lookups. It provides extensive customization for citation key generation while handling LaTeX formatting and Unicode conversion.
