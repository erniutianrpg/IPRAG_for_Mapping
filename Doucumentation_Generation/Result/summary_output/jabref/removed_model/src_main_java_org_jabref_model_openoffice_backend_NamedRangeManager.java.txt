The `NamedRangeManager` interface defines methods for managing named ranges in an OpenOffice text document. It allows creating named ranges at cursor positions (with options for spacing and brackets), retrieving a list of used range names, and fetching a specific named range by its name. The methods throw exceptions for document access issues or creation failures. This interface facilitates interaction with OpenOffice's UNO API for text document manipulation. (98 words)
