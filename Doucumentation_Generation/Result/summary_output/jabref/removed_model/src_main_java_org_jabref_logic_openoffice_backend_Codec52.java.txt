This code defines a utility class `Codec52` for encoding and decoding reference mark names in JabRef 5.2 for OpenOffice integration. It handles:

1. **Parsing** reference mark names into components (index, citation type, citation keys) using regex.
2. **Generating** unique mark names based on citation keys and type, avoiding duplicates.
3. **Validating** if a name follows JabRef's mark name pattern.
4. **Converting** between citation type enums and their integer representations.

The class ensures backward compatibility with JabRef 5.2's naming scheme while providing methods to work with reference marks in documents.
