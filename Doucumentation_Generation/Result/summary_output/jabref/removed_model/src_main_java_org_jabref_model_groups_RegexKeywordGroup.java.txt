The `RegexKeywordGroup` class extends `KeywordGroup` to match BibTeX entries where a specified field's content matches a regular expression. It compiles the regex pattern (with word boundaries) considering case sensitivity. The `contains` method checks if an entry's field matches the pattern. It also includes standard methods for equality comparison, deep copying, and hash code generation based on group properties.
