The `MetaData` class manages metadata for a JabRef database, including citation key patterns, file directories, save actions, encoding, database mode (BibTeX/BibLaTeX), group structures, and content selectors. It provides methods to get, set, and clear these properties, while posting change events via an `EventBus` when modifications occur. The class also handles unknown metadata and includes equality checks, hash code generation, and a string representation. It serves as a central hub for database configuration and preferences.
