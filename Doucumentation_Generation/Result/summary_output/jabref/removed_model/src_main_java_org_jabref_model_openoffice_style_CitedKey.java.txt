The `CitedKey` class represents a cited reference in a document, storing the citation key and related metadata. It maintains backreferences to citation locations (`where`), database lookup results, citation numbers (for numbered styles), unique letters (for author-year styles), and normalized citation markers. The class provides methods to add paths, lookup references in databases, and distribute citation data (like numbers or unique letters) back to the citation groups. It implements interfaces for comparable keys and citation marker normalization.
