The `CitationMarkerNormEntry` interface defines methods to generate normalized author-year citation markers. It provides two key functions: `getCitationKey()` retrieves the citation key from the document, and `getLookupResult()` returns an optional `CitationLookupResult` indicating whether the citation was successfully resolved in databases. An empty result means the citation is unresolved. This interface serves as a bridge between citation keys and their lookup outcomes. (98 words)
