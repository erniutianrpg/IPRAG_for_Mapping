The `StudyDatabase` class models a study database with a name and enabled status. It provides constructors (including one for deserialization), getters/setters for name and enabled status, and overrides `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` methods for proper object comparison and string representation. The class is used to represent database entries in a study management system.
