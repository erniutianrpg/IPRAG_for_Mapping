This Java interface `CitationMarkerNumericBibEntry` defines methods for numeric bibliography labels in citations. It provides:  
1. `getCitationKey()` - returns the citation key for unresolved references.  
2. `getNumber()` - returns an `Optional<Integer>` with the numeric label (empty if the citation is unresolved).  

In under 100 words: It offers access to citation keys and optional numeric labels, distinguishing between resolved (numbered) and unresolved (key-only) references.
