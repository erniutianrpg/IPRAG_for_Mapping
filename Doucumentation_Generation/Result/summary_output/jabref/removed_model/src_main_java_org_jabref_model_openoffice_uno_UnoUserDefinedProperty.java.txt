This code provides utility methods for managing user-defined properties in LibreOffice/OpenOffice text documents. It allows: 
1. Getting a list of property names
2. Retrieving string values of properties
3. Setting/updating string properties (creating them if they don't exist)
4. Removing properties (with options to warn or silently handle missing properties)
The properties are stored at the document level (accessible via File > Properties > Custom Properties in LibreOffice). The methods handle various UNO API exceptions and return Optional values where appropriate.
