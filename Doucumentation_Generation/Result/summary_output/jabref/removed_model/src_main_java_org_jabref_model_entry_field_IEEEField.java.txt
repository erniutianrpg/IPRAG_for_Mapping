This code defines an enum `IEEEField` that represents specific fields used in IEEE BSTctl (Bibliography Style Control) files. Each enum constant corresponds to a field with a name and associated properties (like NUMERIC, YES_NO, or VERBATIM). The class provides methods to get field names, properties, check if it's a standard field, and look up fields by name (case-insensitive). It's essentially a type-safe representation of IEEE bibliography control fields with their metadata.
