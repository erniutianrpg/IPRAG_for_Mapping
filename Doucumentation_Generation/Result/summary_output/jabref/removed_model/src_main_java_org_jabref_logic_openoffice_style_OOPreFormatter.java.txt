The `OOPreFormatter` class preprocesses JabRef bibliography fields by converting LaTeX formatting commands into HTML tags. It handles special characters, italic/bold commands (e.g., `\textit`, `\textbf`), and other LaTeX constructs (e.g., math mode `$...$`), replacing them with HTML equivalents (e.g., `<i>`, `<b>`). It also manages escape sequences and special symbols, ensuring proper rendering in OpenOffice/LibreOffice. The formatter simplifies LaTeX syntax while preserving semantic formatting for later processing.
