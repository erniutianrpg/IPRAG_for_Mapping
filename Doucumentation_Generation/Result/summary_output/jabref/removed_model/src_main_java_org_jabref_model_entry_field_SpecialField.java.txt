This code defines an enum `SpecialField` representing special metadata fields for bibliographic entries (e.g., priority, read status, relevance). Each field has a name and associated values (`SpecialFieldValue`), stored with keywords and mappings for parsing. The class provides methods to access values, keywords, and properties, and to parse field values. It supports operations like checking if a field is single-valued or standard, and converting field names to enum values. Overall, it manages specialized metadata fields and their possible values for bibliographic entries. (98 words)
