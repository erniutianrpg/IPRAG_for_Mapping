This code defines an abstract class `EprintIdentifier` that implements the `Identifier` interface, serving as a base for eprint identifier parsers. Its main purpose is to standardize eprint identifiers by returning `StandardField.EPRINT` as the default field, making code navigation and parser management easier. The class is primarily used for organizational purposes within the codebase. (58 words)
