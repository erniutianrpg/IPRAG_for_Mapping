The `CompareCitation` class implements a `Comparator<ComparableCitation>` that first compares citations using a provided `BibEntry` comparator (handling unresolved keys), then by page information if the entries are otherwise equal. It wraps a `CompareCitedKey` instance for the primary comparison and falls back to `PageInfo.comparePageInfo` for tie-breaking. The constructor accepts a `BibEntry` comparator and a boolean flag to control whether unresolved citations should come first. (98 words)
