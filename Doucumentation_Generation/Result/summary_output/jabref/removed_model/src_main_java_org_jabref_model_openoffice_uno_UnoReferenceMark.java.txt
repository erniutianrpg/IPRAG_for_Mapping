This Java class `UnoReferenceMark` provides utility methods for managing reference marks in an OpenOffice/LibreOffice text document via UNO API. Key functionalities include: retrieving reference marks by name, listing all reference mark names, removing reference marks, getting mark positions, and creating new reference marks. It handles document connection errors and mark existence checks, with methods returning Optional when marks might not exist. The class interacts with OpenOffice's UNO interfaces like `XTextDocument` and `XNameAccess`.
