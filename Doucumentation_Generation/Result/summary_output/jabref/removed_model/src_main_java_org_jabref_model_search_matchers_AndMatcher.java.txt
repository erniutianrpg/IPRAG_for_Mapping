The `AndMatcher` class extends `MatcherSet` and implements a logical AND operation across multiple matchers. It checks if a given `BibEntry` matches all the contained matcher rules by verifying that every matcher in the set returns `true` for the entry. Essentially, it only returns `true` if all matchers in the set match the entry.
