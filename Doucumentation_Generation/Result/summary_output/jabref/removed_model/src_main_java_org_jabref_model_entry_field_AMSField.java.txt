This code defines an `AMSField` enum that implements a `Field` interface, representing fields for AMS (American Mathematical Society) entries. It includes a single field `FJOURNAL` with constructors to initialize field names, display names, and properties. The class provides methods to get field properties, names, and display names, and includes a static method `fromName` to find a field by name. The `isStandardField` method always returns false, indicating these are specialized fields. The enum supports optional display names and field properties through various constructors.
