This abstract class `AbstractGroup` serves as a base for group implementations in JabRef, managing common group properties like name, hierarchy, color, description, and icon. It provides methods to check if entries belong to the group (`contains`, `containsAny`, `containsAll`), supports dynamic group detection (`isDynamic`), and includes property management (getters/setters). The class also implements `SearchMatcher` for entry matching and requires subclasses to implement `deepCopy` for creating group copies. Equality is based on name, description, and hierarchy context.
