This code defines four BibTeX entry types for software-related references using the Biblatex software extension: `Software`, `SoftwareVersion`, `SoftwareModule`, and `CodeFragment`. Each entry type specifies required, important, and detailed fields (like author, title, URL, version) that are relevant for bibliographic software citations. The fields include standard metadata (DOI, date) and software-specific fields (repository, license). All entry types are collected in a final `ALL` list for easy access. This helps in structuring software references in academic papers or documentation. (98 words)
