This code provides utility methods for working with OpenOffice/LibreOffice UNO (Universal Network Objects) properties. It includes functions to:
1. Convert property containers to property sets
2. Retrieve property set information
3. Get property names from various property-related objects
4. Fetch property values as Optional objects, handling unknown properties gracefully
5. Work with both XPropertySet and XPropertyContainer interfaces

The methods help manage and query properties in OpenOffice/LibreOffice documents through UNO API, with null-safety using Optional and proper error handling.
