This code defines a custom annotation `@AllowedToUseSwing` that marks logic classes permitted to access Swing components. The annotation includes a mandatory `value()` parameter to specify the rationale for allowing Swing access, ensuring documentation of why the exception is needed. This helps maintain architectural boundaries in the application.
