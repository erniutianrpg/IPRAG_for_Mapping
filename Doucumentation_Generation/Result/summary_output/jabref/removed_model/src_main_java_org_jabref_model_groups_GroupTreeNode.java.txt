The `GroupTreeNode` class represents a node in a hierarchical groups tree, where each node contains an `AbstractGroup`. It provides functionality to manage groups, including adding/removing subgroups, finding entries that match group criteria, and handling hierarchical relationships between groups. The class supports operations like setting/updating groups, searching for matching entries, and managing group entries (add/remove). It also handles group hierarchy contexts (independent, including, refining) when matching entries. The class is part of a larger system for managing bibliographic references with group-based organization.
