The `EntryTypeFactory` class provides utility methods for working with bibliography entry types. It includes functionality to:
1. Compare two entry types based on their names and fields (`isEqualNameAndFieldBased`)
2. Check if an entry type is exclusive to Biblatex (`isExclusiveBiblatex`)
3. Parse a string into an entry type by matching against known types from various standards (`parse`), defaulting to `UnknownEntryType` if no match is found.

The class serves as a helper for managing different bibliography entry types and their properties.
