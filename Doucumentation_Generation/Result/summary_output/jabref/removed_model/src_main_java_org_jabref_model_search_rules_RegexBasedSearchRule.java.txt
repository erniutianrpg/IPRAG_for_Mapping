The `RegexBasedSearchRule` class implements a regex-based search functionality for BibTeX entries. It validates regex patterns, compiles them (case-sensitive or insensitive based on flags), and searches across entry fields. It strips accents and LaTeX commands from field content before matching. If any field matches the regex pattern or full-text search returns results, it returns true, indicating a successful match. The class extends `FullTextSearchRule` for additional full-text search capabilities.
