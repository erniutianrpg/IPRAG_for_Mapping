This code provides a utility method `insertNamedTextContent` to insert named text elements (like bookmarks, reference marks, or text sections) into a LibreOffice/OpenOffice document. It takes a document, service name, element name, text range, and absorption flag as inputs. The method creates the specified element, sets its name, and inserts it at the given range. If absorption is true, the element incorporates the range's text; otherwise, it's inserted at the range's end. The method returns the named interface of the created element. It handles errors during creation and type casting.
