This code defines an `ISBN` class that validates and processes International Standard Book Numbers (ISBNs). It checks ISBN-10 and ISBN-13 formats, verifies checksums, normalizes input by removing hyphens, and provides methods to validate, parse, and compare ISBNs. It also generates WorldCat search URIs for valid ISBNs. The class ensures correct ISBN formatting and checksum compliance while supporting case-insensitive comparisons.
