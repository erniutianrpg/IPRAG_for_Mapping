The `KeywordList` class manages a collection of hierarchical keywords (e.g., "Type > A"). It provides methods to add, remove, merge, and parse keywords from strings using delimiters. Key features include parsing keyword strings with customizable separators, merging two keyword lists, replacing/removing keywords, and converting the list to a formatted string. The class ensures no duplicates and supports iteration, equality checks, and cloning. It is useful for handling keyword hierarchies in bibliographic data.
