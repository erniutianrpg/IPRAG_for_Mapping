The `UnknownField` class represents a non-standard field in JabRef, storing a field name and optional properties. It implements the `Field` interface, providing methods to get the field name and properties, check if it's standard (always false), and handle equality comparisons (case-insensitive). The class also includes proper `hashCode`, `equals`, and `toString` implementations. Two constructors allow creating fields with or without properties.
