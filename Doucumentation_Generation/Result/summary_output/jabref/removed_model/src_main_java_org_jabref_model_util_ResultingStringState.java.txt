The `ResultingStringState` class is a simple data container that holds two pieces of information: a `String` (`text`) and an integer (`caretPosition`) representing a cursor position within that text. It provides a constructor to initialize these values. This class is likely used to return both a string and a cursor position from a method, such as after text manipulation operations. (49 words)
