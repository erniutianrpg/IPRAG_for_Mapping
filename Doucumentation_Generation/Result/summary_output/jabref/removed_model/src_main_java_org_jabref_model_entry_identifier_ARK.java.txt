The `ARK` class handles Archival Resource Key (ARK) identifiers, which are persistent URLs for long-term access to resources. It supports ARKs with or without the "ark:/" prefix, normalizing them by removing the prefix when present. The class provides methods to parse ARK strings, normalize them, and generate external URIs (using n2t.net as a resolver). Unlike DOIs, ARKs don't support bibliography information lookup, so they can only be opened in a browser. The class extends `EprintIdentifier` for use in eprint fields.
