The `EntryChangedEvent` class is an event notification mechanism in JabRef that signals when a `BibEntry` (bibliography entry) has been modified. It extends `EntriesEvent` and provides two constructors: one accepting just the changed `BibEntry`, and another that also includes the event source location. The class ensures only one entry is affected by wrapping it in a singleton list and provides a method `getBibEntry()` to retrieve the modified entry. This event is used to track changes to bibliography entries in the system. (98 words)
