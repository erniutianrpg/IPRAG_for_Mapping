This code defines an enum `BiblatexApaField` that implements the `Field` interface, representing specific fields used in BibLaTeX-APA bibliography entries. It includes field names like "amendment", "citation", and "section", with some fields having additional properties (e.g., `NUMERIC` or `DATE`). The class provides constructors to initialize field names, display names, and properties, along with methods to retrieve these attributes. The `fromName` method allows looking up a field by name, but only for `BiblatexApaEntryType`. The class handles both standard and custom display names for fields.
