This code defines an enum `OODataModel` representing two citation styles (JabRef52 and JabRef60) that differ in how page information is stored. The `fakePageInfos` method generates a list of `Optional<OOText>` objects, initializing all entries as empty except the last one, which is set to the provided `pageInfo` (if not null) after normalization. This mimics JabRef60's style where page info is stored per citation. The code helps manage citation data formatting for OpenOffice integration. (98 words)
