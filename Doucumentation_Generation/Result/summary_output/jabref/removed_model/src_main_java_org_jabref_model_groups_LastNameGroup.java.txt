The `LastNameGroup` class extends `KeywordGroup` to match BibTeX entries based on a LaTeX-free last name in a specified field. It parses the field as an author list, converts LaTeX to Unicode, extracts last names, and checks if any match the search expression. The `contains` method verifies if an entry's last names (processed to remove LaTeX) include the target name. The class also supports deep copying of group instances.
