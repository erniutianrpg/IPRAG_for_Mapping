The `LatexBibEntriesResolverResult` class stores and manages results from parsing LaTeX files, including citation data and referenced BIB files. It wraps a `LatexParserResult` and tracks new `BibEntry` additions via a `Set`. The class provides access to BIB file paths and citations from the parser result, along with methods to add entries and check equality. Essentially, it acts as a container for LaTeX parsing outcomes and newly discovered bibliography entries.
