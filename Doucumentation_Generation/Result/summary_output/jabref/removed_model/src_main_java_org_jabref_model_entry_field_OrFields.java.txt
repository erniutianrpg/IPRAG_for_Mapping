The `OrFields` class extends `LinkedHashSet<Field>` to represent a set of fields with OR semantics. It provides constructors for single fields, varargs, or collections. Key functionalities include: generating a display name by joining field names with "/" (`getDisplayName()`), getting the primary (first) field (`getPrimary()`), and comparing instances alphabetically based on serialized field names (`compareTo()`). This class is useful for handling alternative field names in bibliographic data.
