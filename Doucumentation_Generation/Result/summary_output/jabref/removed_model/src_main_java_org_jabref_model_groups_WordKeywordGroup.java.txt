The `WordKeywordGroup` class is a specialized group in JabRef that matches BibTeX entries based on whether a specified field contains certain keywords. It supports case-sensitive and case-insensitive searches, different keyword separation strategies, and can add/remove keywords from entries. The class implements three search strategies: string-based (split by words), type-based (for entry types), and keyword list-based (split by a separator). It also provides methods for modifying entries by adding or removing keywords while tracking changes.
