The `TurnServer` class generates TURN server credentials for WebRTC authentication. It creates a username (combining expiry time and user ID) and a password (HMAC-SHA1 signature of the username using a secret key). The credentials include a TTL (time-to-live) and server URL. The `calculateRFC2104HMAC` method implements the RFC 2104 HMAC-SHA1 algorithm to securely generate the password. This enables temporary, secure access to TURN servers for media relay.
