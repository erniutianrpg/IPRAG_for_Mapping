The `PasswordProp2` class is a simple data container that holds two password strings: `moderatorPass` for moderator access and `viewerPass` for viewer access. It provides a constructor to initialize these values and declares them as public final fields, making them immutable after object creation. This class serves as a basic structure for storing and passing password information. (58 words)
