This abstract class `AbstractCommandHandler` extends `NuAbstractProcessHandler` to handle process execution events. It captures and stores stdout/stderr output in StringBuilders, tracks the process exit code, and provides utility methods to check for errors (non-zero exit code), command success, timeouts (exit code 124), and string matches in output. It serves as a base for concrete command handlers in the BigBlueButton presentation system. (98 words)
