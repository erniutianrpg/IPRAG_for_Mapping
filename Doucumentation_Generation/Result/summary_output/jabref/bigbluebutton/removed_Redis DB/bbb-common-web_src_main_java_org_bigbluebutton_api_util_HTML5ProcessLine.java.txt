This code parses process information lines for BigBlueButton's HTML5 backend instances. It extracts the instance ID and CPU usage percentage from input strings (like those from `ps` command output). The constructor splits the input, reads the CPU percentage, and finds the instance ID by locating the "NODEJS_BACKEND_INSTANCE_ID" marker. The `toString()` method formats these values for display. Essentially, it helps monitor individual HTML5 backend processes' CPU usage. (98 words)
