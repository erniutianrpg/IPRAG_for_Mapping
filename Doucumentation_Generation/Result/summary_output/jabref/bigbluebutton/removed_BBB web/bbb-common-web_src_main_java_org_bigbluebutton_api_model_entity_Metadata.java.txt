This Java class defines a `Metadata` entity for a database table named "metadata" using JPA annotations. It stores key-value pairs associated with a `Recording` entity (many-to-one relationship). The class includes fields for ID, key, value, and recording reference, along with standard getters/setters. It also overrides `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` methods for proper object comparison and string representation. The entity is part of a larger system (likely BigBlueButton) for storing recording metadata.
