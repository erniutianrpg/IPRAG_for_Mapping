The code defines a custom Java annotation `@PatternList` that can be applied to methods, fields, parameters, etc. It stores an array of `@Pattern` annotations and is retained at runtime. This annotation is likely used for validating multiple pattern constraints on elements where it's applied. The annotation doesn't contain implementation logic itself but serves as a container for multiple pattern constraints.
