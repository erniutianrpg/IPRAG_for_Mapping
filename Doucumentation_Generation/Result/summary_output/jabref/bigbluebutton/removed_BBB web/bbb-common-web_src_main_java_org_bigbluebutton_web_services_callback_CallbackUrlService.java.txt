This code implements a callback URL service that asynchronously processes meeting-ended events. It uses a delay queue to handle retries with increasing delays (30s, 1m, 2m, 5m) for failed callbacks, giving up after 5 attempts. The service makes HTTP GET requests to callback URLs, logging success/failure analytics data in JSON format. It supports redirect following (up to 5 redirects) and runs in separate threads for message processing and execution. The service can be started/stopped, and it handles callback events with immediate first attempts followed by scheduled retries if needed.
