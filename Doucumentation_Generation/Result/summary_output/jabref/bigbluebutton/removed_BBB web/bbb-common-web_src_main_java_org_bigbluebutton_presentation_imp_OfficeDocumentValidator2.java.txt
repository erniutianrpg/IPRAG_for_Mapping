This code validates PowerPoint (PPTX) files in an uploaded presentation. It checks if the file extension is PPTX, then executes an external command (with a 20-second timeout) to validate the file. If validation fails, it logs an error with meeting details. The `presCheckExec` path is configurable via setter. Returns `true` if valid or not PPTX, `false` if validation fails.
