This code defines a `RecordingServiceHelper` interface with two methods:  
1. `getRecordingInfo(File dir)` - Retrieves recording information from a specified directory.  
2. `writeRecordingInfo(String path, Recording info)` - Writes recording metadata to a given path.  

It's part of BigBlueButton's API for managing recording data, allowing reading and writing recording details. The interface supports the open-source web conferencing system's recording functionality.
