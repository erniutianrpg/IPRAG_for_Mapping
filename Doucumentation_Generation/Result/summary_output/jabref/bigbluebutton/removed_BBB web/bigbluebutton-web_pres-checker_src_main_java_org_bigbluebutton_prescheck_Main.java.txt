This Java code checks PowerPoint files (PPTX) for three potential issues: 1) embedded EMF images, 2) small background tile images, and 3) all slides being hidden. It uses Apache POI to parse the PPTX file and Apache Commons Collections for filtering. The program returns exit codes: 0 for valid files, 2 for files with issues, and 1 for processing errors. Each check is implemented as a predicate that examines specific file properties (content type, checksum, or slide visibility).
