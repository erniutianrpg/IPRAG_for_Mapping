The `Geom` class provides geometric utility methods for 2D operations, including:

1. **Line-Point Tests**: Checking if a point lies on a line segment within a tolerance.
2. **Direction Calculations**: Determining relative directions (top, bottom, left, right) between points.
3. **Intersections**: Finding intersection points between line segments.
4. **Distance/Length**: Computing distances between points or from a point to a line.
5. **Rectangle Utilities**: Growing rectangles, checking containment, and finding edge points (north, south, etc.).
6. **Angle Conversions**: Converting between angles and points on rectangles/ovals.

The class supports both integer (`int`) and floating-point (`double`) coordinates and is part of the JHotDraw library.
