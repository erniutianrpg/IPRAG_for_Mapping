This Java class `Breakout` represents a breakout room in a meeting system. It stores three attributes: `parentMeetingId` (the main meeting ID), `sequence` (breakout room order number), and `meetingId` (breakout room ID). The class uses Jackson XML annotations for XML serialization and provides getter/setter methods for each attribute. It's a simple data model for managing breakout room information in a parent-child meeting structure. (98 words)
