The `LockSettingsParams` class is a Java data container that stores various meeting lock settings, such as disabling cameras (`disableCam`), microphones (`disableMic`), private/public chats (`disablePrivateChat`, `disablePublicChat`), notes (`disableNotes`), hiding user lists (`hideUserList`), locking on join (`lockOnJoin`), and hiding viewers' cursors (`hideViewersCursor`). It provides a constructor to initialize these boolean settings, representing restrictions or visibility controls in a meeting. (99 words)
