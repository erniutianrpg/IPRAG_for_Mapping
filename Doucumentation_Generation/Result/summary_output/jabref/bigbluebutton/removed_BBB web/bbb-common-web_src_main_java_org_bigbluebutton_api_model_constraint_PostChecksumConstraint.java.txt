This code defines a custom Java annotation `@PostChecksumConstraint` for validating checksums. It's a class-level annotation (`@Target(TYPE)`) processed at runtime (`@Retention(RUNTIME)`), using `PostChecksumValidator` to perform validation. The annotation includes default values for error key, message, validation groups, and payload. It's typically used to ensure data integrity by verifying that checksums match before processing requests.
