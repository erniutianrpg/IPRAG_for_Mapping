This code defines a `HTML5ProcessLine` class that parses process information lines from BigBlueButton's HTML5 backend. It extracts the CPU usage percentage and instance ID from input strings (typically from `ps` command output) formatted like `1.1 ... NODEJS_BACKEND_INSTANCE_ID=1`. The class stores these values and provides a `toString()` method to display them. Essentially, it helps monitor individual HTML5 backend processes' CPU usage and instance identifiers. (98 words)
