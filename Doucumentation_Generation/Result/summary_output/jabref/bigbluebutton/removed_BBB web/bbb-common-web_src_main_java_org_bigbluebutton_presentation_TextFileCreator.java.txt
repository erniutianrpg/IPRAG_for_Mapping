This code defines a Java interface `TextFileCreator` with a single method `createTextFile()`. The interface is part of the BigBlueButton presentation system. The method takes an `UploadedPresentation` object and a page number as parameters, and returns a boolean indicating whether it successfully created a text file for that presentation page. The purpose is to abstract text file creation functionality for presentations.
