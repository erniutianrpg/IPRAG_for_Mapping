The `Bezier` class provides algorithms for fitting smooth Bezier curves to a set of digitized points (like hand-drawn strokes). Key functionalities include:

1. **Curve Fitting**: Converts digitized points into a Bezier path with minimal error (`fitBezierPath`).
2. **Preprocessing**: Cleans input data by removing close points (`removeClosePoints`), reducing noise (`reduceNoise`), and splitting at sharp corners (`splitAtCorners`).
3. **Bezier Generation**: Uses least-squares approximation (`generateBezier`) and iterative refinement (`reparameterize`) to create optimal curves.
4. **Vector Math Utilities**: Includes helper methods for vector operations (normalization, scaling, etc.).

The class is based on Philip J. Schneider's thesis for automatic fitting of hand-sketched curves.
