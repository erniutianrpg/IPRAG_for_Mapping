This code implements a scheduled cleanup task for BigBlueButton meetings. It uses a `ScheduledExecutorService` to periodically run a `CleanupTask` that purges entered users via the `MeetingService`. The task starts after 60 seconds and repeats every 30 seconds (configurable). The `stop()` method shuts down the scheduler. Essentially, it manages user cleanup in meetings at regular intervals.
