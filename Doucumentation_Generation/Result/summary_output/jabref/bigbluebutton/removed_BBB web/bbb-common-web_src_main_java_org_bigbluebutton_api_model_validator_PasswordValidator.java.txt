The `PasswordValidator` class validates password strings based on a `PasswordConstraint`. It checks if a password is non-null, non-empty, and between 2 to 64 characters in length. If the password fails these criteria, it logs an error and returns `false`; otherwise, it returns `true`. This is a custom validator for password fields in Java Bean Validation.
