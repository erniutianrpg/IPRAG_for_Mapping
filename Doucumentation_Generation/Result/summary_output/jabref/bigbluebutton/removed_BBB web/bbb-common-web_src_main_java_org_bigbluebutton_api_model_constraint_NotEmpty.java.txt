This code defines a custom `@NotEmpty` annotation for Java Bean Validation. It marks fields/methods that must not be empty, with a default error message "Field must contain a value". The annotation is processed by `NotEmptyValidator` at runtime and can target various elements (fields, methods, etc.). It's also repeatable via `@NotEmptyList` and includes configurable properties like error key, message, and validation groups.
