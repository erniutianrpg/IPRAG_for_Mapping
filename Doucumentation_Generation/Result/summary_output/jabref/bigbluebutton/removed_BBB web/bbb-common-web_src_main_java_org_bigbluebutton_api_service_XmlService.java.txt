The `XmlService` interface defines methods for converting various entities (like recordings, metadata, playback formats) to XML strings and vice versa. It includes functionality to transform collections of recordings, individual recordings, and related objects into XML format, as well as parse XML back into recording objects. Additionally, it provides methods to construct XML responses for paginated results and handle cases where no recordings exist. Essentially, it serves as a utility for XML serialization/deserialization of meeting recording data in a BigBlueButton API context. (98 words)
