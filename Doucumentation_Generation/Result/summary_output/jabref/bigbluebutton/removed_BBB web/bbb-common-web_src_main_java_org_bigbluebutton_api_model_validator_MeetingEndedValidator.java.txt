This code is a validator that checks if a BigBlueButton meeting has been forcibly ended. It implements `ConstraintValidator` for the `MeetingEndedConstraint` annotation. Given a meeting ID, it verifies the meeting exists and returns `false` if the meeting is null or was forcibly terminated, otherwise `true`. Essentially, it ensures a meeting is still active and not manually ended.
