The `RecordingMetadata` class acts as a wrapper for `RecMeta` objects, providing getter and setter methods to manage recording metadata. It allows setting and retrieving the recording state (like "published" status), a map of metadata key-value pairs, and delegates all operations to the contained `RecMeta` instance. Essentially, it simplifies interaction with recording metadata while encapsulating the underlying `RecMeta` object. (94 words)
