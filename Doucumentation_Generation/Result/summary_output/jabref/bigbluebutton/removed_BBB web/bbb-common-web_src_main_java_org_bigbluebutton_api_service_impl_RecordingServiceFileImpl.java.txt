This code implements a recording service for BigBlueButton, handling recording management operations. Key functionalities include:

1. Managing recording states (published/unpublished/deleted) by moving files between directories
2. Processing recording metadata and playback formats
3. Handling presentation file downloads and captions
4. Providing filtered recording listings with pagination
5. Updating recording metadata
6. Tracking recording status via marker files
7. Validating and managing text tracks for recordings

The service works with a file-based storage system, organizing recordings in different directories based on their state (published, unpublished, etc.) and providing CRUD operations for recordings and their metadata.
