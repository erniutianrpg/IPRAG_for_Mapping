This Java class `GuestPolicy` defines constant string values representing different guest access policies in a meeting system. It includes policies like always accepting (`ALWAYS_ACCEPT`) or denying (`ALWAYS_DENY`) guests, requiring moderator approval (`ASK_MODERATOR`), and always accepting authenticated users (`ALWAYS_ACCEPT_AUTH`). It also provides constants for guest responses: `ALLOW`, `DENY`, and `WAIT`. Essentially, it serves as an enumeration of possible guest policy options and responses. (94 words)
