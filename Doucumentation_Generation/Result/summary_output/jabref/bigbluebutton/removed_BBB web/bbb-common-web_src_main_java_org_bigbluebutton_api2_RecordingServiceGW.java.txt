This code defines a `RecordingServiceGW` interface for handling recording-related operations in a BigBlueButton system. It includes methods to: retrieve recordings in a 2x format, get/save recording metadata from/to XML files, validate text track tokens, fetch recording text tracks, and upload new text tracks. The interface supports both Java and Scala (via `scala.Option`) and deals with recording metadata, file handling, and track management. (98 words)
