This code defines an abstract Java class `Password` representing a shared meeting password entity. It contains two fields: `meetingID` (validated as non-empty) and `password`, with standard getter and setter methods for both. The class serves as a base for concrete password implementations in a meeting system, ensuring a meeting ID is always provided.
