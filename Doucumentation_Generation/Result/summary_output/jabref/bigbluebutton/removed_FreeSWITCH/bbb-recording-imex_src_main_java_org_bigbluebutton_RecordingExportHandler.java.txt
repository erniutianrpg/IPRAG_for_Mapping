The `RecordingExportHandler` class exports recording metadata to XML files. It provides methods to export either all recordings or a specific one by ID. For each recording, it creates a directory named after the recording ID, generates an XML file (`metadata.xml`) containing the recording's data, and formats it with proper indentation and encoding. The class uses a singleton pattern, `DataStore` for data access, and `XmlService` for XML conversion. Errors are logged if the export fails.
