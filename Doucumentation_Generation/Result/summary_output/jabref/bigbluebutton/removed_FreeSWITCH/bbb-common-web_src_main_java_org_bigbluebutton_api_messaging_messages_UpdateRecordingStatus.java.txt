The `UpdateRecordingStatus` class is a message object that carries information about a meeting's recording status. It contains two fields: `meetingId` (identifies the meeting) and `recording` (a boolean indicating if recording is on/off). This immutable class implements `IMessage` and is used to communicate recording status updates between system components. (49 words)
