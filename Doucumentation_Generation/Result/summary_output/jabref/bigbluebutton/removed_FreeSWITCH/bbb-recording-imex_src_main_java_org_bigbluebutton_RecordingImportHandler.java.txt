The `RecordingImportHandler` class manages the import of recording metadata from XML files. It uses a singleton pattern to provide a single instance, with dependencies on `DataStore` for persistence and `XmlService` for XML parsing. The main methods `importRecordings` and `importRecording` scan a directory for recordings, parse their metadata from `metadata.xml` files, convert them to `Recording` objects, and optionally persist them. If recordings already exist, they are skipped. Errors during file reading or parsing are logged.
