This code validates PowerPoint PPTX files by checking for two specific issues: embedded EMF (Enhanced Metafile) images and small background tile images. It uses Apache POI to inspect the PPTX file, logging warnings if either issue is found. The validation fails if the file can't be opened or contains these prohibited elements. The class logs analytics data (meeting ID, presentation ID, etc.) for tracking purposes using Gson for JSON serialization.
