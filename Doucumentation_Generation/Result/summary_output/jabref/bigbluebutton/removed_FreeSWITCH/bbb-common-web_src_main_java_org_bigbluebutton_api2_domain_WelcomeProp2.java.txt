The `WelcomeProp2` class is a simple data container that holds three string properties related to welcome messages: `welcomeMsgTemplate` (a template for welcome messages), `welcomeMsg` (the actual welcome message), and `modOnlyMessage` (a message visible only to moderators). It provides a constructor to initialize these immutable (final) fields. This class appears to be part of a larger system handling meeting or session configurations.
