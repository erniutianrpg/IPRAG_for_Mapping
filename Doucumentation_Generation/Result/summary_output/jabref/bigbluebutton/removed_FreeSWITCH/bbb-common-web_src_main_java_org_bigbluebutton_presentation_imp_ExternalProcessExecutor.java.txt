The `ExternalProcessExecutor` class executes external system commands with a timeout. It provides two methods: a deprecated one that splits a command string by whitespace, and a preferred one that takes a list of command arguments. Both methods run the command, discard its output, and return true only if the command completes within the timeout and exits successfully (exit code 0). If the process times out or fails, it's terminated and returns false. The class handles IO and interruption errors gracefully.
