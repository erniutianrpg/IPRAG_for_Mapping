The `Extension` class represents a generic extension with a type and associated properties. It provides getter and setter methods for both the extension type (String) and its properties (Map<String, Object>). This simple data container class allows storing and retrieving extension information in a key-value format, likely used for extending functionality in the BigBlueButton conferencing system.
