The code defines a Java interface `RecordingServiceHelper` with two methods for managing recording information in BigBlueButton, an open-source conferencing system. The interface provides functionality to:  
1. Retrieve recording metadata from a directory (`getRecordingInfo`)  
2. Save recording metadata to a specified path (`writeRecordingInfo`).  

This serves as a helper for handling recording-related operations in the system. (94 words)
