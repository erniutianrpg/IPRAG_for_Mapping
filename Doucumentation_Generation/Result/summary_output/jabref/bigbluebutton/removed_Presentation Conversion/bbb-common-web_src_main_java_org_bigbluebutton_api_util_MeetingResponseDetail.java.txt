The `MeetingResponseDetail` class is a simple data container that holds information about a meeting and its creation timestamp. It has two private fields: `createdOn` (String) and `meeting` (Meeting object), initialized via constructor. It provides getter methods (`getCreatedOn()` and `getMeeting()`) to access these fields. This class serves as a response object for meeting-related data in the BigBlueButton API. (58 words)
