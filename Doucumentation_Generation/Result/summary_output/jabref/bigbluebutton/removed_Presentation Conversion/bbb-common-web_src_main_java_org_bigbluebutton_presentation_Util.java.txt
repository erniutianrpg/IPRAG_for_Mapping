This code provides utility methods for file directory operations in BigBlueButton's presentation system. It contains two main functions:  

1. `deleteDirectory(File directory)`: Recursively deletes all files and subdirectories within a given directory before deleting the directory itself.  
2. `deleteDirectoryFromFileHandlingErrors(File presentationFile)`: Safely deletes a directory and its contents after checking for null and handling potential errors, logging any exceptions.  

The code ensures proper cleanup of presentation files and directories while managing potential errors. (99 words)
