The `KeepAliveMessage` class represents a simple keep-alive message in a messaging system. It contains a constant for the message type (`KEEP_ALIVE_REQUEST`), a version number (`0.0.1`), and a `keepAliveId` string that is set via the constructor. This class is likely used to maintain connection liveliness between systems by periodically sending these messages. (58 words)
