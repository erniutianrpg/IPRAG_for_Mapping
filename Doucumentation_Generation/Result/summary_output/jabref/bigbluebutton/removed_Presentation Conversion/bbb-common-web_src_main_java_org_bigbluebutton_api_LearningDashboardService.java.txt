This code manages learning dashboard data for BigBlueButton meetings. It provides functionality to: 
1. Create/retrieve JSON data files for meeting dashboards
2. Write activity JSON data to files 
3. Remove dashboard files after a configurable delay
4. Clean up directories recursively
5. Set custom storage directories

The service stores dashboard data in `/var/bigbluebutton/learning-dashboard` by default, organized by meeting ID and access token. Files are automatically cleaned up after meetings end.
