The `ParamsUtil` class provides utility methods for string manipulation and validation in a meeting API context. Key functionalities include: stripping control characters from strings, escaping HTML tags, validating meeting IDs by checking for invalid characters, extracting session tokens from URLs, and sanitizing strings by removing control characters and trimming whitespace. It uses Apache Commons libraries for HTML escaping and string operations.
