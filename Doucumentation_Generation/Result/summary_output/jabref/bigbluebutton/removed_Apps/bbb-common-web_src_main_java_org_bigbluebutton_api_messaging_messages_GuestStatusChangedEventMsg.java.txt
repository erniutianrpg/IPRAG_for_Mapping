The code defines a `GuestStatusChangedEventMsg` class that implements `IMessage`, representing a message about guest status changes in a meeting. It contains the meeting ID (`meetingId`) and a list of guest statuses (`guests`). The constructor initializes these fields when creating an instance of the message. This class is likely used to notify about updates to guest permissions or statuses in a meeting system. (60 words)
