The `VoiceProp2` class is a simple data container that holds three string properties related to voice communication: `telVoice` (telephone voice), `webVoice` (web voice), and `dialNumber` (dial-in number). It provides a constructor to initialize these immutable (final) fields. This class is likely used to transfer voice configuration data within the application. (47 words)
