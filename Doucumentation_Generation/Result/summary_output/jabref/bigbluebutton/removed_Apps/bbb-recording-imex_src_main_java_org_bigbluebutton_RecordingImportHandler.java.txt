The `RecordingImportHandler` class imports and processes recording metadata from XML files. It scans a specified directory for recordings, checks if they exist in the data store, and imports new ones by parsing their `metadata.xml` files into `Recording` objects using an `XmlService`. The class follows a singleton pattern and can optionally persist imported recordings to the data store. Key operations include directory scanning, file reading, XML parsing, and data storage.
