The `RecordingMetadata` class acts as a wrapper for `RecMeta` objects, providing getter and setter methods to manage recording metadata. It allows setting/getting the recording state (like "published"), its publication status (boolean), and a map of key-value metadata pairs. Each setter updates the `RecMeta` instance by returning a new instance (immutable pattern). Essentially, it simplifies interaction with `RecMeta`'s properties. (98 words)
