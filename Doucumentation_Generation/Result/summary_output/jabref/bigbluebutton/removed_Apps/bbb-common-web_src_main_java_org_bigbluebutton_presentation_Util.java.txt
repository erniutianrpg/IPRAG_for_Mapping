This code provides utility methods for file directory operations in the BigBlueButton presentation system. It contains two main methods:  

1. `deleteDirectory(File directory)`: Recursively deletes all files and subdirectories within a given directory before deleting the directory itself.  

2. `deleteDirectoryFromFileHandlingErrors(File presentationFile)`: Safely deletes a presentation file's parent directory while handling potential exceptions, logging errors if they occur.  

Both methods ensure proper cleanup of directories and files.
