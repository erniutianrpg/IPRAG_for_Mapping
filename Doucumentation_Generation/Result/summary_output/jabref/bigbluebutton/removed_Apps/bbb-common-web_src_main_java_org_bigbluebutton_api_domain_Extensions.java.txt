The `Extensions` class is a simple Java POJO (Plain Old Java Object) that holds a `Preview` object. It uses Jackson XML annotations (`@JacksonXmlProperty` and `@JacksonXmlElementWrapper`) to control XML serialization/deserialization. The class provides getter and setter methods to access and modify the `preview` field. Its main purpose is to represent an XML structure where a `preview` element can be nested within an `extensions` element. (Word count: 63)
