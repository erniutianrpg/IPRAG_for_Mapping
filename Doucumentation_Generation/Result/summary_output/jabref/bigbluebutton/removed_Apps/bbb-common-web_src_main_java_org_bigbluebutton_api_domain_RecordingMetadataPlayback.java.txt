This Java class `RecordingMetadataPlayback` represents playback metadata for a recording in XML format (using Jackson XML annotations). It stores information like format, link, processing time, duration, extensions, and size of a recording. The class provides getter/setter methods for these fields and includes a utility method `calculateDuration()` to convert duration from milliseconds to minutes. It's designed to serialize/deserialize recording playback data to/from XML.
