The `Page` class is a simple Java class that represents a presentation page with a page number. It has:
1. A constructor that initializes the page number (`num`)
2. A getter method `getNum()` to retrieve the page number
3. An immutable design (page number can't be changed after construction)

The class serves as a basic container for page information in a presentation system. (49 words)
