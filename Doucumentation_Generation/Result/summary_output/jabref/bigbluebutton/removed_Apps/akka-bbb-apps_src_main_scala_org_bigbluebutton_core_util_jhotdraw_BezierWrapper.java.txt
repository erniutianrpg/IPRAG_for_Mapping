The `BezierWrapper` class converts a list of normalized points into a smoothed Bézier curve. It denormalizes input points (scaling them from percentage-based to actual coordinates), fits a Bézier curve to them using `Bezier.fitBezierPath()`, then normalizes the resulting curve points back to percentage-based coordinates. The final smoothed path is returned as a `PathData` object containing the normalized points. The helper methods `denormalize()` and `normalize()` handle the coordinate conversions. This is useful for simplifying and smoothing freehand drawings or paths. (98 words)
