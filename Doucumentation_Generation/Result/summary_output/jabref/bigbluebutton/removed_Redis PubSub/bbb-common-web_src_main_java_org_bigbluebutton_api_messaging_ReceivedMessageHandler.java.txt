This code implements a message handler that processes incoming messages from a Redis pub/sub system. It uses a producer-consumer pattern with a blocking queue to handle messages asynchronously. The `start()` method initializes a thread that continuously takes messages from the queue and processes them by notifying listeners via a `MessageDistributor`. The `handleMessage()` method adds incoming messages to the queue. The `stop()` method halts message processing. The system ensures thread-safe message handling using single-threaded executors for both queue processing and listener notification.
