This code implements a Redis message sender using Lettuce client. It creates a connection pool for Redis PubSub, starts a single-threaded executor to process messages from a blocking queue, and publishes them to specified Redis channels. The `start()` method initializes the connection, while `send()` queues messages and `publish()` asynchronously sends them. The `stop()` method shuts down connections. It handles reconnections and includes password authentication if configured. Messages are sent asynchronously via a dedicated thread to avoid blocking.
