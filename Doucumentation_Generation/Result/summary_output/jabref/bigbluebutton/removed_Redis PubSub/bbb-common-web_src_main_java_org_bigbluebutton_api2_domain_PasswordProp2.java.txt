The `PasswordProp2` class is a simple data container that stores two password strings: one for moderators (`moderatorPass`) and one for viewers (`viewerPass`). It provides a constructor to initialize these values and declares them as public final fields, making them immutable after object creation. This class serves as a basic structure for holding password-related data. (58 words)
