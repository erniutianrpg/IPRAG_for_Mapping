The `VoiceProp2` class is a simple immutable data container that holds three voice-related properties: `telVoice` (telephone voice), `webVoice` (web voice), and `dialNumber` (dial-in number). It provides a constructor to initialize these values and exposes them as public final fields, ensuring they cannot be modified after instantiation. This class is likely used to store and pass voice configuration data in a BigBlueButton API context. (72 words)
