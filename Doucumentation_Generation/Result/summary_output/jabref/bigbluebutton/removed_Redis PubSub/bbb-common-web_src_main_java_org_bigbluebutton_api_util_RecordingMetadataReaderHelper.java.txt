The `RecordingMetadataReaderHelper` class acts as a helper for managing recording metadata in the BigBlueButton API. It provides methods to validate text track tokens, retrieve and store text tracks, fetch and save recording metadata (including from XML files), and interact with a `RecordingServiceGW` gateway for these operations. The class serves as an intermediary between the API and the underlying recording service.
