This module provides core messaging and recording management infrastructure for BigBlueButton, a web conferencing system. It handles Redis-based pub/sub messaging for distributed communication between components, including message distribution, reception, and processing. The module also manages recording operations (import/export of metadata) and includes supporting utilities for TURN server configuration, presentation validation, and system health monitoring. The architecture emphasizes asynchronous message handling and data persistence while maintaining loose coupling between components.
