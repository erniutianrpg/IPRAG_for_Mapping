This code implements a message handler for Redis pub/sub messages. It uses a blocking queue to receive messages (`handleMessage`) and processes them asynchronously with two single-threaded executors. One thread (`messageProcessor`) continuously takes messages from the queue, while the other (`runExec`) distributes each message to listeners via a `MessageDistributor`. The handler can be started (`start`) and stopped (`stop`), and it logs errors if no listeners are registered. Essentially, it decouples message reception from processing, enabling efficient asynchronous message handling.
