The `CreateMeeting` class is a message implementation that encapsulates a `Meeting` object for communication purposes. It serves as a data transfer object (DTO) to create and pass meeting information within a messaging system, likely used in a larger application like BigBlueButton for handling meeting creation events. The class contains a single immutable `Meeting` field initialized via its constructor.
