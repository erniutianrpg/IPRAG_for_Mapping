It includes constants for the event name (`DELETED_RECORDING_EVENT`) and version (`VERSION`), and a field `recordId` to store the recording ID. The constructor initializes the `recordId` when creating an instance of this message. This class is likely used in a messaging system to notify about deleted recordings. (Word count: 62)
