The `RecordingMetadataReaderHelper` class acts as a helper for managing recording metadata in BigBlueButton. It provides methods to validate text track tokens, retrieve/save text tracks, fetch recording metadata from XML files, and handle recording data conversions. The class delegates most operations to a `RecordingServiceGW` instance, serving as a bridge between the API and core recording services for metadata operations. Key functionalities include text track management, metadata retrieval/saving, and XML file handling.
