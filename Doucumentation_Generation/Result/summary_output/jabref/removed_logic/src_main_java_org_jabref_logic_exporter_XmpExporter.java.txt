The `XmpExporter` class exports BibTeX entries to XMP (Extensible Metadata Platform) files in Dublin Core format. It can either write all entries to a single XMP file or split them into separate files (if the filename contains "split"). The exporter uses `XmpUtilWriter` to generate XMP content and writes it to the specified file(s). The class handles null checks and skips empty entry lists. File naming for split exports incorporates entry IDs and citation keys.
