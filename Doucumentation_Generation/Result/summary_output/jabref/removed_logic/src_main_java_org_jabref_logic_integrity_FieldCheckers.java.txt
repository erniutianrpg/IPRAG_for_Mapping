The `FieldCheckers` class manages integrity checks for BibTeX/BibLaTeX fields by associating each field with specific validation rules (`ValueChecker` implementations). It initializes a map of field-checker pairs during construction, including checks for person names, titles, DOIs, etc., with some checks specific to BibLaTeX mode. The class provides methods to retrieve all checkers or checkers for a specific field. This ensures data consistency and validity in bibliography entries.
