The `FulltextFetcher` interface defines a contract for classes that retrieve full-text PDF URLs for BibTeX entries. It includes a method `findFullText` that takes a `BibEntry` and returns an `Optional<URL>` for the PDF, throwing exceptions for errors. It also provides a default `getTrustLevel` method to indicate the fetcher's reliability, defaulting to `UNKNOWN`. Implementations should specialize in fetching PDFs from specific article sources.
