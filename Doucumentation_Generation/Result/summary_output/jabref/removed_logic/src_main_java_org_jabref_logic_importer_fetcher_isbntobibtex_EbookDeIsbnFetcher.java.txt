This code implements an ISBN fetcher for the `ebook.de` website that converts ISBNs to BibTeX entries. It extends `AbstractIsbnFetcher` to validate ISBNs, construct the query URL, and fetch data. The `doPostCleanup` method processes the fetched entry by normalizing page numbers (removing non-digits) and author names, while preserving the URL field. The fetcher is named "ISBN (ebook.de)" and uses the base URL `https://www.ebook.de/de/tools/isbn2bibtex`.
