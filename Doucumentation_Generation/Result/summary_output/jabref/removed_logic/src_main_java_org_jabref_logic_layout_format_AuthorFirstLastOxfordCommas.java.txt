This code defines a `LayoutFormatter` that formats author names in a bibliography entry with first names first, separated by commas, and includes an Oxford comma before the final "and" in lists of three or more authors. It uses `AuthorList.fixAuthorFirstNameFirstCommas()` to process the input string (`fieldText`), ensuring the output follows the specified name order and comma conventions. The formatter handles multiple authors separated by commas and enforces the Oxford comma rule. (98 words)
