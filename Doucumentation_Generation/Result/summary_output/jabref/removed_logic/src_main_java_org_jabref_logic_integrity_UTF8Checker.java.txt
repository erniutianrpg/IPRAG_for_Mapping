The `UTF8Checker` class verifies if all fields in a BibEntry are UTF-8 encoded. It takes a `Charset` parameter and checks each field's byte array using a UTF-8 decoder. If any field fails decoding (throws `CharacterCodingException`), it adds an integrity message indicating non-UTF-8 encoding. The result is a list of such warnings for non-compliant fields. Essentially, it ensures text fields adhere to UTF-8 encoding standards.
