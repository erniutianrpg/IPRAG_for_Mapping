This code defines a `LayoutFormatter` called `AuthorFirstLastCommas` that formats author names in a bibliography entry. It displays names as "first name von last name" without abbreviating first names, separates multiple authors with commas, and omits the Oxford comma before "and" in lists of three or more authors. The formatting is delegated to `AuthorList.fixAuthorFirstNameFirstCommas()`.
