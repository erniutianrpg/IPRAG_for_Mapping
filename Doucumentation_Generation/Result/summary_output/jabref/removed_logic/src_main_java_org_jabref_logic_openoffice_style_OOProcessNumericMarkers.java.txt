This code generates numbered citation markers for a bibliography in OpenOffice, handling two sorting methods: by order of appearance or by a custom comparator (author-year-title). It processes each citation group, creates numbered markers based on the chosen sorting, and assigns them to the groups. The class assumes global and local ordering is already applied and works with a specified citation style.
