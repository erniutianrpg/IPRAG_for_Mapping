This code implements a fetcher for zbMATH (Zentralblatt Math) that retrieves bibliographic data in BibTeX format. It supports three search methods: by entry (matching metadata like title, author), by query (using Lucene syntax), and by identifier (zbMATH ID). The fetcher constructs appropriate API URLs, processes JSON responses, and performs post-cleanup on BibTeX entries (e.g., moving fields, removing braces). It uses Unirest for HTTP requests and BibtexParser for parsing responses. The class implements three fetcher interfaces: SearchBasedParserFetcher, IdBasedParserFetcher, and EntryBasedParserFetcher.
