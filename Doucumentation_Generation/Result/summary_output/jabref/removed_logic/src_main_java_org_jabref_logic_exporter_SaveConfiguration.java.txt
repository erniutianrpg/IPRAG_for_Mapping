The `SaveConfiguration` class manages settings for saving BibTeX files in JabRef, including file encoding, backup creation, save order, reformatting, and save type (ALL/SELECTED). It provides getter methods and fluent setters (`withX()`) to modify these settings. Default values are set in the no-arg constructor. The class is primarily used to configure how bibliographic data is persisted to disk.
