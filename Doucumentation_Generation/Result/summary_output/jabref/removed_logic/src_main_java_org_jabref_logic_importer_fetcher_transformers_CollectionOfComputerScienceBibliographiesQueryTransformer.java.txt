This code defines a query transformer for the Collection of Computer Science Bibliographies (CoCSB) search engine. It extends `AbstractQueryTransformer` and specifies how to convert different search components (authors, titles, journals, years) into CoCSB's query syntax. It uses spaces for AND, "OR" for OR, and "-" for NOT operations. Authors and titles are formatted as key-value pairs ("au:author", "ti:title"), journal titles are quoted if they contain spaces, and years are prefixed with "year:". This enables structured queries compatible with CoCSB's search API. (98 words)
