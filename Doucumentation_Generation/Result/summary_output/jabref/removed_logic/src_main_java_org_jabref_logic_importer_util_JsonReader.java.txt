The `JsonReader` class provides utility methods to convert an `InputStream` into either a `JSONObject` or `JSONArray`. It reads the stream's content as a UTF-8 string and parses it into the respective JSON structure. If the input is empty or blank, it returns an empty JSON object or array. Exceptions during parsing or reading are wrapped in a `ParseException`. This is useful for handling JSON data from input streams in a robust manner.
