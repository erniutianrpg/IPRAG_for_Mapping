The `Title` class represents a BibTeX entry title, splitting it into individual `Word` objects. It parses a title string into words upon construction, provides immutable access to these words, and offers methods to retrieve the first and last words (returning `Optional.empty()` if empty). The `toString()` method reconstructs the title by joining the words with spaces. Essentially, it's a utility for managing and manipulating title words in a BibTeX context. (98 words)
