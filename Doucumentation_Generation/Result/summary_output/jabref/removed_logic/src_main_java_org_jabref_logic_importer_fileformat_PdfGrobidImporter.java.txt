The `PdfGrobidImporter` class is a wrapper for the `GrobidService` that enables importing bibliographic data from PDF files. It implements the `Importer` interface, supporting PDF file recognition and parsing via Grobid (a machine learning library for extracting metadata from scholarly documents). The main functionality processes a PDF file path, extracts `BibEntry` objects, and attaches the PDF as a linked file. Unsupported methods (like `BufferedReader` or `String` inputs) throw exceptions. It checks for valid PDF extensions and provides metadata like name, ID, and description.
