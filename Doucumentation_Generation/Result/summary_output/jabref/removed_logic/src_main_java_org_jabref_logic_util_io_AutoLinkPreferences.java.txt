The `AutoLinkPreferences` class manages preferences for auto-linking files in JabRef, including how citation keys relate to filenames (start, exact match, or regex), a regular expression pattern, a flag for prompting about PDF auto-naming, and a keyword separator character. It provides getters, setters, and JavaFX property accessors for these preferences. Two constructors are available: one for general use with an `ObjectProperty<Character>` and another for testing with a direct `Character` value.
