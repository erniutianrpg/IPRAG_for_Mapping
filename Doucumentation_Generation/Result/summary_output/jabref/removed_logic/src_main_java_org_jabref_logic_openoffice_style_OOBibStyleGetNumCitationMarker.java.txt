This code provides functionality for generating numeric citation markers in OpenOffice documents. Key features include:

1. Formatting bibliography entries with configurable brackets (e.g., "[1]")
2. Creating in-text citations with:
   - Support for single citations (e.g., "1")
   - Range citations (e.g., "1-3") when minGroupingCount is met
   - Page info handling (e.g., "1 pp 20")
3. Proper sorting and grouping of citations
4. Handling unresolved citations with placeholders
5. Configurable separators and formatting through OOBibStyle

The code maintains citation integrity while allowing flexible formatting options for different bibliography styles.
