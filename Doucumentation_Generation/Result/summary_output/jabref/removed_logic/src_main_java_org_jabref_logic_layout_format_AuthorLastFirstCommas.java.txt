This code defines a `LayoutFormatter` called `AuthorLastFirstCommas` that formats author names in a bibliography entry. It displays names as "von last, jr, first" without abbreviating first names, separates authors with commas, and omits a comma before the final "and" in lists of three or more authors. The formatter delegates the actual formatting to `AuthorList.fixAuthorLastNameFirstCommas()`.
