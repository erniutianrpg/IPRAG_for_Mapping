This code implements a fetcher for the DiVA portal, a Swedish repository of research publications and theses. The `DiVA` class, an `IdBasedParserFetcher`, retrieves BibTeX entries by constructing a URL with a given identifier (starting with "diva2:"). It uses `BibtexParser` to parse the fetched data and includes help page support. The main functionality involves generating a DiVA API URL for a specified identifier and validating the identifier format.
