The `FetcherServerException` class is a custom exception in Java that extends `FetcherException`. It is thrown when HTTP server errors (status codes >= 500) occur during fetching operations. The class provides three constructors to handle different scenarios: with an error message, with a message and cause, and with separate error and localized messages plus a cause. This helps in propagating server-related fetch errors with appropriate context.
