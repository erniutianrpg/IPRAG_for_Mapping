This code defines a `DatabaseSynchronizer` interface for synchronizing a local database with a shared one. It includes methods to pull changes, synchronize entries (`BibEntry`), open/close shared databases, register listeners, and manage connection properties. The interface supports bidirectional synchronization between local and shared databases, handling operations like entry updates and database connectivity.
