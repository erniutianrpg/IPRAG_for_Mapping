The `RepecNepImporter` class is a Java importer for parsing New Economics Papers (NEP) messages from the RePEc service. It processes plain text files containing economic research paper references, extracting metadata like titles, authors, abstracts, keywords, URLs, and JEL classifications. The importer follows a semi-formal grammar to identify and parse structured sections of the NEP message, converting them into BibTeX entries. It handles multi-line fields, recognizes specific keywords, and skips irrelevant sections like overviews. The parsed data is stored as `BibEntry` objects for use in JabRef, a reference management software.
