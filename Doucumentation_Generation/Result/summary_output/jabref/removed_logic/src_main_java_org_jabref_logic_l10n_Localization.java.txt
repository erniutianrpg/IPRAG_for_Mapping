The `Localization` class manages language translations for JabRef, loading and caching localized messages from resource bundles. It provides methods to set the language (`setLanguage`), retrieve translations (`lang`), and access the message bundle (`getMessages`). Translations are stored in unescaped form for fast access, with support for parameter replacement (e.g., `%0`, `%1`). If a translation is missing, it falls back to English and logs a warning. The class ensures efficient lookup and handles locale-specific resource loading.
