The `BvbFetcher` class implements a search-based fetcher for the Bibliotheksverbund Bayern (BVB) library network. It constructs a URL with query parameters to search the BVB SRU interface (maximum 30 records) and returns results in MARCXML format, parsed by a `MarcXmlParser`. The fetcher transforms Lucene queries into SRU-compatible queries using `DefaultQueryTransformer`. It's marked as experimental with no help page available.
