The `TitleParser` class parses a title string into a list of `Word` objects, splitting on whitespace. It tracks protected characters (enclosed in curly braces `{}`) to preserve their case. Each `Word` contains its characters and a boolean array indicating protected positions. The parser handles nested braces and ensures protected regions remain unchanged during subsequent processing. The main `parse` method processes each character, builds words between spaces, and marks protected characters using `determineProtectedChars`. Words are created via `createWord` when whitespace is encountered or at the string's end.
