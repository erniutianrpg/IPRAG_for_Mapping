The `ComplexSearchQuery` class represents a structured search query for bibliographic data, supporting fields like authors, titles, abstracts, journals, years, and DOI. It uses a builder pattern to construct queries from terms, validates inputs, and handles different search parameters. The class provides methods to access search fields, compare queries, and generate string representations. The builder ensures at least one text field is set before creating a query and handles year ranges and single-year searches.
