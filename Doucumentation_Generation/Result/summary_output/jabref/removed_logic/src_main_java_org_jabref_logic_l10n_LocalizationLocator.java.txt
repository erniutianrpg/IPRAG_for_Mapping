This code implements a resource locator for localization in JabRef. The `LocalizationLocator` class implements the `ResourceLocator` interface and overrides the `getResourceBundle` method to return a `ResourceBundle` containing localized messages. The bundle is obtained via `Localization.getMessages()`, providing centralized access to internationalized strings for the application's UI. Essentially, it serves as an adapter between Afterburner's resource loading system and JabRef's localization mechanism. (75 words)
