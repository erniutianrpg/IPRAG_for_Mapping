The `INSPIREFetcher` class fetches bibliographic data from the INSPIRE database. It supports search queries via Lucene and can fetch entries based on DOI or arXiv identifiers. The fetcher performs post-cleanup on entries by removing unwanted fields (like "SLACcitation"), braces from titles, and converting LaTeX to Unicode. It uses BibTeX format for parsing and handles API requests with appropriate headers. The class implements both `SearchBasedParserFetcher` and `EntryBasedFetcher` interfaces for flexible querying.
