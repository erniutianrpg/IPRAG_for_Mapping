The `DoiDuplicationChecker` class checks a BibTeX database for duplicate DOIs across entries. It scans all entries, groups them by their DOI, and identifies entries sharing the same DOI. For each set of duplicates, it generates an integrity warning message indicating that the same DOI is used in multiple entries. The result is a list of these warning messages, helping users detect and resolve DOI duplication issues in their bibliography database.
