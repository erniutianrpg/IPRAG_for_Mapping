The `CrossRef` class is a fetcher for retrieving bibliographic entries from the CrossRef API using DOIs, entry metadata, or search queries. It implements multiple fetcher interfaces to support different lookup methods. The class constructs API URLs, parses JSON responses into `BibEntry` objects, handles author and publication data, and performs post-fetch cleanup. It also includes title-based similarity checks to match fetched entries with input queries. The fetcher primarily targets journal articles and supports fields like title, author, year, DOI, and ISSN.
