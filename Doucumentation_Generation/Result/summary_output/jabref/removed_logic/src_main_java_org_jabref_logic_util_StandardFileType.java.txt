The `StandardFileType` enum defines various file types used in JabRef, each with a descriptive name and associated file extensions (without dots). It implements the `FileType` interface, providing methods to get extensions (`getExtensions()`) and names (`getName()`). The `fromExtensions()` method matches given extensions to known file types or returns an `UnknownFileType` if no match is found. This class serves as a centralized repository for supported file types in the application. (98 words)
