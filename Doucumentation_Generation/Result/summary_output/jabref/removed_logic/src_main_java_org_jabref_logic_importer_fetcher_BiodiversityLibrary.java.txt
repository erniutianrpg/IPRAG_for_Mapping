The `BiodiversityLibrary` class is a fetcher that retrieves bibliographic data from the Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL) API. It implements `SearchBasedParserFetcher` to search publications and `CustomizableKeyFetcher` for API key management. The class constructs URLs for API requests, processes JSON responses, and converts them into `BibEntry` objects with fields like title, author, and publisher. It handles both item and part metadata, supports custom API keys, and transforms Lucene queries into BHL-compatible search terms. Errors during parsing are caught and logged.
