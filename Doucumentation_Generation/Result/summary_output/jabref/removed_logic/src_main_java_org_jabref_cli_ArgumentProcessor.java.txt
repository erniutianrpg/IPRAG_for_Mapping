The `ArgumentProcessor` class handles command-line arguments for JabRef, a reference management software. It processes various commands including importing/exporting files, fetching entries from online sources, generating citation keys, setting file links, and managing preferences. The class parses arguments, performs corresponding operations (like file I/O, database operations, and metadata handling), and returns results. It supports both GUI and headless modes, with functionality for version display, help, and preference management. Key features include BibTeX file processing, PDF metadata operations, and integration with web fetchers.
