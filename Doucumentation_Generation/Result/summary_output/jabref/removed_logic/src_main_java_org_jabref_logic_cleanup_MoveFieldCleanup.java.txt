The `MoveFieldCleanup` class implements a cleanup job that moves content from one field to another in a BibEntry. It takes a source field and target field as parameters. During cleanup, it copies the value from the source field to the target field (if the source exists), clears the source field, and returns a list of field changes made. This effectively moves data between fields in a bibliography entry.
