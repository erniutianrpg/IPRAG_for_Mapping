This code defines a `Version` class for managing software version information in JabRef. It parses version strings (e.g., "3.4-dev") into components (major, minor, patch, development stage), compares versions, checks for updates against GitHub releases, and provides version-related URLs. Key features include version parsing with regex patterns, version comparison logic, fetching releases from GitHub API, and generating changelog URLs. The class handles stable/development versions and different release stages (alpha/beta/stable).
