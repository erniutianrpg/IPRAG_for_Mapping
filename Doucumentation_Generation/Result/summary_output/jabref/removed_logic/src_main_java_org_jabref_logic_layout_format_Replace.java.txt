The `Replace` class is a formatter that performs regex-based string replacement. It takes a two-part argument (separated by an escaped comma) where the first part is the regex pattern to match and the second is the replacement text. The `format` method applies this replacement to the input string. For example, it can replace all commas with semicolons or whitespace with underscores. The class handles argument parsing and applies the replacement using Java's `String.replaceAll()`.
