The `BstWidthCalculator` class calculates the width of a string for BibTeX formatting purposes. It uses predefined character widths (based on a specific font) stored in a static array. The `width()` method processes a string, handling special characters (like ligatures) within braces and skipping control sequences, while accumulating widths for printable characters. It also checks for balanced braces and logs warnings for mismatches. The widths are relative values used for comparison in BibTeX's formatting logic.
