The `BstVMContext` class is a record in Java that represents the execution context for a BST (BibTeX Style) virtual machine. It stores BibTeX entries, string/integer variables, functions, a stack for operations, a BibDatabase reference, and an optional file path. The constructor initializes default empty collections for maps and stack while accepting entries, database, and path parameters. This context is used to maintain state during BST style file processing. (98 words)
