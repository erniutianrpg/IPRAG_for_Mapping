This code defines a `LayoutFormatter` that formats author names in a bibliography entry with: first names first (unabbreviated), 'von' and 'last' names in order, and commas separating authors. The last author in a list of three or more is preceded by 'and' without a comma. It uses `AuthorList.fixAuthorFirstNameFirstCommas()` to implement this formatting.
