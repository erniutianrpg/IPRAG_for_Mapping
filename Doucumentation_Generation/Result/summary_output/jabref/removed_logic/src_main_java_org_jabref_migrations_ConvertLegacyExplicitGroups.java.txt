This code migrates legacy explicit groups in a bibliography database from an old format (where groups stored entry lists) to a new format (where entries store their group memberships). It scans all groups, identifies legacy `ExplicitGroup` instances with old-style entry keys, and updates them to the new format by assigning entries to groups and clearing the legacy keys. The migration operates on the database metadata after opening it.
