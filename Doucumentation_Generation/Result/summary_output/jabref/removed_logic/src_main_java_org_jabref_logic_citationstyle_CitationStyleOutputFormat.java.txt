This code defines an enum `CitationStyleOutputFormat` that represents different output formats for citations in JabRef. It provides two formats: HTML (with `<br>` line breaks) and TEXT (with no special line breaks). Each format has a name and a line separator string. The enum includes methods to get the format name and line separator, and overrides `toString()` to return the format name. Essentially, it encapsulates output format options for citation styling.
