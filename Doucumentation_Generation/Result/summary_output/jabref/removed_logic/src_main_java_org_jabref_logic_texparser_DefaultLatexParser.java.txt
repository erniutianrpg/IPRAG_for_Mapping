The `DefaultLatexParser` class parses LaTeX files to extract citation keys, bibliography file references, and nested file inclusions. It uses regex patterns to identify citations (`\cite` commands), bibliography files (`\bibliography` or `\addbibresource`), and included files (`\include` or `\input`). The results are stored in a `LatexParserResult` object, which tracks citations, bibliography files, and parsed files. The parser handles recursive file inclusions and skips comments/blank lines. Errors during parsing are logged but don't halt execution. The class is part of JabRef's logic for processing LaTeX documents.
