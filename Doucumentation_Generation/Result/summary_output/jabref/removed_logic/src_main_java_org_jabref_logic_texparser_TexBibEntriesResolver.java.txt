This code resolves BibTeX entries cited in LaTeX files and checks if they exist in a given database. It loads databases from BIB files, processes citations from LaTeX files, and identifies new entries not present in the master database. It also handles cross-referencing by filling empty fields in entries with data from referenced entries. The result includes all new BibTeX entries found during resolution. Key functionalities include citation resolution, database loading, and cross-referencing field completion.
