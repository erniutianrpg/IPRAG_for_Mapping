The `FieldWriter` class converts JabRef's internal BibTeX field representation into BibTeX text format. It handles field content formatting, validates brace balancing, and processes BibTeX string markers (`#`). Key features include:
- Checking for balanced braces and proper escaping
- Resolving string references (like `#jan#`) based on field preferences
- Formatting content with or without string resolution
- Handling edge cases like escaped characters and invalid syntax
- Throwing `InvalidFieldValueException` for malformed input

The class uses `FieldPreferences` to determine formatting rules and which fields should resolve strings.
