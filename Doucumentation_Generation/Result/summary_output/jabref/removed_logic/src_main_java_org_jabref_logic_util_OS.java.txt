This code detects the operating system (OS) by checking the `os.name` system property and defines constants for OS-specific values. It identifies Linux, Windows, and macOS (OS_X) systems, stores the system's file separator and newline characters, and provides application directory constants for JabRef. The class is not meant to be instantiated (private constructor).
