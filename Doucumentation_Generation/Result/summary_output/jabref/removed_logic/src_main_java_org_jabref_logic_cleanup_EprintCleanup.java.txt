The `EprintCleanup` class is a cleanup job that processes arXiv identifiers in a BibTeX entry. It checks specific fields (URL, Journal, JournalTitle, Note) for arXiv identifiers, normalizes them, and moves them to the `EPRINT` field with type "arxiv". It also handles classification and clears the original field. If the original field was URL, it additionally clears the URL-date field. The changes are tracked and returned as a list of `FieldChange` objects. Essentially, it standardizes arXiv identifier storage in BibTeX entries. (98 words)
