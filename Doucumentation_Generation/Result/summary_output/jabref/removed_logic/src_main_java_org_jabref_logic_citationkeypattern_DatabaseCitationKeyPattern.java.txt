The `DatabaseCitationKeyPattern` class extends `AbstractCitationKeyPattern` and provides citation key patterns for database entries. It uses a `GlobalCitationKeyPattern` to retrieve pattern values for specific entry types. The key method `getLastLevelCitationKeyPattern` delegates to the global pattern to return the citation key pattern list for a given entry type. Essentially, it acts as an adapter between database-level patterns and global patterns. (78 words)
