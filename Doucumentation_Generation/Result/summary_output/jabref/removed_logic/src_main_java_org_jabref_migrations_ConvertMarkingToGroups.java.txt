This code migrates legacy explicit groups in JabRef, where entries were marked with group assignments, to a new format where groups contain their entries. It scans entries for markings (e.g., `[Owner:ID]`), organizes them into groups under a "Markings" parent group, and clears the old markings. If no groups exist, it initializes a default group structure. The migration preserves all marked entries while updating to the new group storage format.
