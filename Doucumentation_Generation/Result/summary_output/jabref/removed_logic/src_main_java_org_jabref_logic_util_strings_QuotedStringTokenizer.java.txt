The `QuotedStringTokenizer` class tokenizes a string while respecting quoted characters (which are not treated as delimiters). It skips leading delimiters initially. The `nextToken()` method returns substrings split at unquoted delimiters, preserving quoted characters (including delimiters) as part of the token. The `hasMoreTokens()` method checks if more tokens exist. Unlike standard tokenizers, it differentiates between quoted and unquoted delimiters, making it useful for parsing strings with escaped or quoted sections.
