This code manages field formatting cleanups for BibTeX entries in JabRef. It provides predefined cleanup actions (like normalizing dates, pages, and converting HTML/Unicode to LaTeX) and supports parsing/serializing cleanup configurations. Key functionalities include:

1. Default and recommended cleanup actions for BibTeX/BibLaTeX
2. Applying formatters to BibEntry fields when enabled
3. Converting between string representations and cleanup configurations
4. Grouping formatters by field and maintaining enablement status

The class serves as a central hub for managing and executing field formatting operations in JabRef.
