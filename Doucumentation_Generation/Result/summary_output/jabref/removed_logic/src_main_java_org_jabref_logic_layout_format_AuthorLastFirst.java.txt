This code defines a `AuthorLastFirst` class that implements the `LayoutFormatter` interface. Its `format` method takes a string `fieldText` containing author names and returns them reformatted in "Lastname, Firstname" order by calling `AuthorList.fixAuthorLastNameFirst()`. Essentially, it transforms author names from "Firstname Lastname" to "Lastname, Firstname" format.
