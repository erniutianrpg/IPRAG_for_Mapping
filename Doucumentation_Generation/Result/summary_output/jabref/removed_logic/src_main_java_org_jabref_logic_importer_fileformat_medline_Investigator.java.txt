The code defines an immutable `Investigator` record class in Java that stores basic information about a researcher: their last name (`lastName`), first name (`foreName`), and a list of their affiliations (`affiliationList`). Records automatically provide implementations for `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` based on their components. This class is likely used to represent author/contributor data when importing Medline-formatted bibliographic data.
