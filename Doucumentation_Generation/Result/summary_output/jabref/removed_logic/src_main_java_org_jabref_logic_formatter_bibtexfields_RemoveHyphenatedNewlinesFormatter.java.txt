This Java class `RemoveHyphenatedNewlinesFormatter` is a formatter that removes hyphenated line breaks from text. It detects patterns where a hyphen is followed by a line break (`-\n`) using regex, removes them, and trims the result. For example, "Gimme shel-\nter" becomes "Gimme shelter". It's part of a BibTeX field cleanup utility, providing localization support for its name, description, and example.
