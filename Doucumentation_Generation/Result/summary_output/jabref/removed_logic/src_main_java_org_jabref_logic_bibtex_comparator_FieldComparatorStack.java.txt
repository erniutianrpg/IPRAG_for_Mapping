The `FieldComparatorStack` class implements a cascading comparator that applies a list of comparators in sequence. It compares two objects using the first comparator; if they're equal (returns 0), it proceeds to the next comparator, and so on. If all comparators return 0, the final result is 0. This allows for hierarchical comparison logic where earlier comparators have higher priority.
