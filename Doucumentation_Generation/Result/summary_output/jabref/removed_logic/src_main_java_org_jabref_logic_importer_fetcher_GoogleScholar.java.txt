This code implements a Google Scholar fetcher for JabRef that searches for full-text PDFs and bibliographic entries. It can:

1. Search for PDFs using article titles and return the first valid PDF link found
2. Perform paginated searches for bibliographic entries in BibTeX format
3. Handle Google Scholar's traffic limitations and CAPTCHAs
4. Transform search queries to match Google Scholar's syntax
5. Parse and return BibTeX entries from search results

The fetcher respects Google Scholar's limitations and provides appropriate error handling when hitting traffic limits or encountering CAPTCHAs.
