The `CoarseChangeFilter` class filters database change events, specifically `FieldChangedEvent`s, to only relay significant changes. It tracks the last modified field and entry, and forwards events only if: 1) the change involves a new field/entry, 2) the edited field/entry differs from the last one, or 3) the change is major (e.g., pasting text with >1 character). Other events are forwarded unchanged. Listeners can register/unregister to receive filtered events. The class helps reduce noise by suppressing minor, consecutive edits to the same field.
