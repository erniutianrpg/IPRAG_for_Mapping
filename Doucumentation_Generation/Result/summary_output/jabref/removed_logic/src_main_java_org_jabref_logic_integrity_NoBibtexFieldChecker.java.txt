The `NoBibtexFieldChecker` class checks if a BibTeX entry contains any fields that are exclusive to BibLaTeX (not supported in BibTeX). It identifies BibLaTeX-only fields by comparing against standard BibTeX fields, excluding common fields like `ABSTRACT`, `COMMENT`, `DOI`, and `URL`. For each BibLaTeX-only field found in an entry, it generates an integrity warning message indicating the field is BibLaTeX-specific. This helps ensure compatibility with BibTeX. The core functionality involves filtering and comparing field definitions between BibTeX and BibLaTeX.
