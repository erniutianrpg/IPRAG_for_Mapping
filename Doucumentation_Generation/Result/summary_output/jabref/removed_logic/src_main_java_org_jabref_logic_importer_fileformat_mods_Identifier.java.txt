The code defines a simple immutable Java record `Identifier` with two fields: `type` (String) and `value` (String). Records automatically provide constructor, getters, `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` methods. This class serves as a basic data holder for identifier information, where `type` represents the identifier's category (e.g., "DOI", "ISBN") and `value` stores the actual identifier string. It's likely used in MODS (Metadata Object Description Schema) metadata processing. (50 words)
