The `UpperCaseFormatter` converts all characters in a string to uppercase, except for words enclosed in curly braces `{}`. It extends a `Formatter` class, provides metadata like name, key, description, and example, and processes the input by treating it as a `Title` object where each word (excluding braced ones) is converted to uppercase. For example, "Kde {Amarok}" becomes "KDE {Amarok}".
