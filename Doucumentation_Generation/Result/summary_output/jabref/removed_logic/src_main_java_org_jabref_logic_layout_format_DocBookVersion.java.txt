This code defines a simple Java enum `DocBookVersion` that represents two versions of DocBook (a document markup language): `DOCBOOK_4` and `DOCBOOK_5`. The enum serves as a type-safe way to reference these specific versions within the codebase, likely for formatting or processing documents in different DocBook formats. The enum contains no additional methods or fields, acting purely as a version identifier. (49 words)
