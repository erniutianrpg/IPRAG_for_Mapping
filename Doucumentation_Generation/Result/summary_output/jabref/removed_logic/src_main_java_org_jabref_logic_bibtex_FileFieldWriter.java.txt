The `FileFieldWriter` class converts `LinkedFile` objects (representing file attachments) into encoded string representations. It handles single or multiple files, encoding them with `:` separating file attributes (description, link, type) and `;` separating different files. Special characters (`:`, `;`, `\`) are escaped with backslashes. For example, a file with description "doc", link "file.pdf", and type "PDF" would be encoded as `doc:file.pdf:PDF`.
