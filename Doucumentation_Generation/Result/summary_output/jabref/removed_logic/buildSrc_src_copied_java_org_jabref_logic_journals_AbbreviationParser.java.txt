The `AbbreviationParser` class reads journal abbreviation data from CSV files (either from resources or file system) and stores them in a collection. It processes each CSV record, expecting fields for full journal name, abbreviation, and optional shortest unique abbreviation. The parsed abbreviations are stored in a `LinkedHashSet` to maintain order and prevent duplicates. The class provides methods to read from different sources (resource files or file paths) and returns the collected abbreviations. Error handling includes logging IO exceptions.
