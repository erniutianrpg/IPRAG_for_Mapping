The `AbbreviationChecker` class checks BibTeX entries for abbreviated journal names in specified fields (book-related fields). It uses a `JournalAbbreviationRepository` to detect abbreviations. For each entry, it verifies if any field value is abbreviated and adds an integrity warning message if found. The warnings indicate that an abbreviation was detected, helping maintain consistent journal name formatting in bibliographies.
