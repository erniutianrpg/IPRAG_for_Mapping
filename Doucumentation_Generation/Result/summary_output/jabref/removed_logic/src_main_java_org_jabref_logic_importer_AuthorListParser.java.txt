The `AuthorListParser` class parses a string of author names (e.g., "Last, First and von der Last2, First2") into an `AuthorList` object containing structured author information. It handles:

1. Name separation by commas, "and", or semicolons  
2. Name parts like "von", "jr", or TeX special characters  
3. Case sensitivity and abbreviations  
4. Special cases like "and others"  
5. Proper splitting into first/last/von/junior name parts  

The parser tokenizes input, identifies name components, and constructs `Author` objects with normalized formatting. It supports BibTeX-style names with complex formatting rules.
