The `RemoteListenerServerThread` class extends `Thread` to manage a remote listener server in JabRef. It initializes a `RemoteListenerServer` with a message handler and port, and names the thread accordingly. The thread can be interrupted to gracefully shut down the server by closing its socket. The `run()` method delegates execution to the server. This enables clean server termination, e.g., when JabRef closes. (98 words)
