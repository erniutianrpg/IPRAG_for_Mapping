The `UnknownFileType` class implements a `FileType` interface to handle unknown file types. It stores file extensions (normalized to lowercase without dots) and provides methods to: 
- Retrieve extensions (`getExtensions`)
- Compare equality based on sorted extensions (`equals`)
- Generate hash codes (`hashCode`)
- Return a descriptive name (`getName`). 

The class ensures case-insensitive comparison and dot-removal for consistent extension handling.
