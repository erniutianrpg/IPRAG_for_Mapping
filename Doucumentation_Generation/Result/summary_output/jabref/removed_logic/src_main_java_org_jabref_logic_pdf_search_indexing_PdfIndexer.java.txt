The `PdfIndexer` class manages a Lucene search index for PDF files linked to BibTeX entries in JabRef. It provides methods to create, update, and delete indexes, ensuring they stay synchronized with the filesystem. Key functionalities include adding/removing PDFs associated with entries, checking file timestamps to avoid redundant indexing, and listing indexed file paths. The class uses Lucene's `IndexWriter` and `IndexSearcher` for efficient text indexing and searching, with English stemming for improved search results.
