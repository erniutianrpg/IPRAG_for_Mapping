This code implements a fetcher for the "Collection of Computer Science Bibliographies" database. It constructs search URLs from Lucene queries, parses the results, and performs post-processing cleanup on BibTeX entries. The cleanup includes formatting abstracts (removing newlines, tabs, redundant spaces) and editor fields (removing digits), and processing identifier fields to extract and normalize metadata like ISBNs, DOIs, and Scopus IDs into separate fields. The fetcher integrates with JabRef's import system.
