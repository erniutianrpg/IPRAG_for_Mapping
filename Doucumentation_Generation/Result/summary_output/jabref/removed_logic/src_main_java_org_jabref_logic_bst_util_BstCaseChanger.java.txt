The `BstCaseChanger` class provides functionality to change the case of strings according to different formatting modes (title case, all lowercase, or all uppercase) while respecting LaTeX-style braces (`{}`). It handles special characters (like accents or ligatures) and maintains proper brace nesting. The main method `changeCase` processes a string based on the specified format mode, preserving content within braces and converting case for text outside them. Special cases like "oe" or "AE" are handled appropriately for each format.
