This code implements a full-text fetcher for academic papers using the oaDOI (Open Access DOI) API. Given a BibEntry with a DOI, it queries the oaDOI service to find an open-access version of the paper. The fetcher sends an HTTP request to the oaDOI API, processes the JSON response to extract the best open-access URL, and returns it as a URL object. If no DOI is present or the request fails, it returns an empty result. The trust level is set to META_SEARCH, indicating it relies on aggregated metadata.
