The `NoteChecker` class validates the `note` field in BibTeX entries, ensuring the first letter is capitalized (as per BibTeX specifications). For non-biblatex databases, it checks if the first character of the note is not lowercase and returns a warning if not. Blank values are ignored. The check is skipped for biblatex mode, which handles capitalization automatically.
