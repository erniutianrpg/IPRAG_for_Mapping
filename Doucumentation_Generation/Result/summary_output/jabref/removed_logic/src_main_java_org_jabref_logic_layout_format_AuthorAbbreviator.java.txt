This code defines an `AuthorAbbreviator` class that implements the `LayoutFormatter` interface. It formats a string of author names by parsing them into an `AuthorList` and then converting them to a last-name-first format with abbreviated first names, separated by "and". Essentially, it transforms input like "John Doe and Jane Smith" into "Doe, J. and Smith, J.". This functionality is identical to the `AuthorLastFirstAbbreviator` class.
