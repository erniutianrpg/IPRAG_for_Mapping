This code implements a `ProxyAuthenticator` that extends Java's `Authenticator` class to handle proxy authentication. It checks if the request is for a proxy, then retrieves proxy settings (host, port, username, password) from system properties based on the protocol (e.g., HTTP/HTTPS). If the requesting host and port match the configured proxy settings, it returns a `PasswordAuthentication` object with the credentials. Otherwise, it returns `null`, indicating no authentication is provided. This enables automatic proxy authentication when making network requests.
