The `FileType` interface defines a contract for file types, requiring implementations to provide a list of file extensions and a name. It includes a default method `getExtensionsWithAsteriskAndDot()` that transforms each extension into a "*.ext" format (e.g., "*.txt"). This allows extending the `StandardFileType` enum with custom file types for exporters. In short, it standardizes file type handling with extensions and names, providing a formatted extensions list.
