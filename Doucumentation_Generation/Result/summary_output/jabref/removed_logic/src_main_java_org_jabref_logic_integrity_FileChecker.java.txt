The `FileChecker` class verifies if file paths referenced in a BibTeX database are valid. It checks each linked file entry (excluding online links) to ensure the file exists at the specified path. If a file is missing or the path is invalid, it returns an error message. The check considers the database context and user file preferences for path resolution. Blank values pass without error. This ensures data integrity by validating file attachments in bibliographic entries.
