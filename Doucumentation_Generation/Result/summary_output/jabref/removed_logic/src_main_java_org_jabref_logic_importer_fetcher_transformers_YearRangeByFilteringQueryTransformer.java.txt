This code provides client-side year range filtering for fetchers that don't support server-side year filtering. The `YearRangeByFilteringQueryTransformer` class stores start and end years (defaulting to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` and `MIN_VALUE` when unset) and returns them via `getStartYear()` and `getEndYear()`. The `handleYearRange()` method parses the year range but returns an empty string since filtering occurs client-side. This allows JabRef to filter results by year after fetching all records from the server.
