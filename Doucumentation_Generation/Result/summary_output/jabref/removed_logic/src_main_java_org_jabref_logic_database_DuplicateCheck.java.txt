This code provides functionality for detecting duplicate BibTeX entries in a bibliography database. It compares entries using weighted field comparisons (like author, title, DOI), with special handling for identifiers, names, and journal fields. The main method `isDuplicate()` checks if two entries are likely duplicates based on a similarity threshold (0.75). It prioritizes required fields first, then optional fields if needed. The class also includes helper methods for field-specific comparisons (pages, chapters, etc.) and can search an entire database for duplicates of a given entry.
