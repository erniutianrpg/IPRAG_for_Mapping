The `ZbMathQueryTransformer` class extends `AbstractQueryTransformer` to convert search queries into a format suitable for the ZbMath API. It defines logical operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`) and methods to handle specific search fields like author, title, journal, year, and unfielded terms. Each field is mapped to a corresponding API parameter (e.g., "au" for author, "ti" for title) and formatted as key-value pairs. Unfielded terms are mapped to a general "any" field. This transformer ensures queries are properly structured for ZbMath's search syntax.
