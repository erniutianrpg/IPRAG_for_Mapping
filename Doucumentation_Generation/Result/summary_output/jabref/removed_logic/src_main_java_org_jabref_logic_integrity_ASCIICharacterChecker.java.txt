The `ASCIICharacterChecker` class checks BibTeX entries for non-ASCII characters (like umlauts or Unicode) in any field. For each entry, it scans all fields and uses `CharMatcher.ascii()` to verify if the content is ASCII-only. If non-ASCII characters are found, it adds an `IntegrityMessage` to the results list, indicating the field with the issue. The method returns a list of such integrity violations.
