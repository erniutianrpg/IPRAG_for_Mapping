This code formats author names according to the ISO 690 standard. It processes a string of authors separated by "and", handling different name formats:
1. For "FirstName LastName" formats, it converts surnames to uppercase and rearranges to "LASTNAME, FirstName".
2. For "LastName, FirstName" formats, it keeps the order but uppercases the surname.
3. It properly handles multiple authors, separating them with commas or " y " for the last two. 
The output follows ISO 690's surname-first, comma-separated format with appropriate punctuation between authors.
