This code migrates PDF and PostScript file links from separate fields (`pdf` and `ps`) into the unified `file` field of a BibTeX entry. It preserves existing file links, converts the old field values into `LinkedFile` objects, clears the original fields, and updates the `file` field with the combined list. The changes are tracked and returned as `FieldChange` objects. This cleanup ensures file links are consistently stored in the `file` field.
