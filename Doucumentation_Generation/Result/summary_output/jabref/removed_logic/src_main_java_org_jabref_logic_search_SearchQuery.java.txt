The `SearchQuery` class implements a search functionality for BibTeX entries. It supports different search modes (case-sensitive/insensitive, plain text/regular expressions) and provides methods to validate queries, check matches against entries, and generate search patterns. The class can escape special characters for Java or JavaScript regex, parse search queries into words, and localize descriptions. It uses different search rules (`ContainsBasedSearchRule`, `GrammarBasedSearchRule`) based on the query type.
