This code formats author names in a bibliography entry with specific rules: last names first (including 'von' prefixes), abbreviated first names, commas separating authors, and an Oxford comma before the final 'and' in lists of three or more authors. It implements the `LayoutFormatter` interface to transform author lists in citations.
