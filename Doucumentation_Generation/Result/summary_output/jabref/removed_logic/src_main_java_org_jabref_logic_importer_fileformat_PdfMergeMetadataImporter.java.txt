The `PdfMergeMetadataImporter` class imports and merges metadata from PDF files using multiple strategies (embedded BibTeX, XMP, GROBID, etc.). It attempts to extract bibliographic data from a PDF, supplements it with DOI/ISBN lookups if available, and merges the results into a single BibEntry. The `EntryBasedFetcherWrapper` subclass enables searching metadata from files linked to a BibEntry. The importer prioritizes non-empty fields during merging and attaches the PDF file to the resulting entry.
