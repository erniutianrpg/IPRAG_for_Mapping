This code is a formatter that converts bibliographic record types into corresponding numeric codes used by OpenOffice. It implements a `LayoutFormatter` interface with a `format` method that takes a text input (like "Article", "Book") and returns a specific number (e.g., "Article" becomes "7"). Unrecognized types default to "10" (Miscellaneous). The mapping aligns with OpenOffice's reference type numbering system.
