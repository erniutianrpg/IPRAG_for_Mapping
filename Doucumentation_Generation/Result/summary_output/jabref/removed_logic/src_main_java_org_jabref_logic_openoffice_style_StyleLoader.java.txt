The `StyleLoader` class manages bibliography styles for OpenOffice integration in JabRef. It loads both internal (default) and external (user-added) citation styles, validates them, and maintains their lists. Key functionalities include: loading default styles from resources, adding/removing external styles, validating styles, and tracking the currently used style. Styles are stored as `OOBibStyle` objects, with preferences managed via `OpenOfficePreferences`. Invalid styles are logged and ignored. The class ensures valid styles are available and provides access to all loaded styles.
