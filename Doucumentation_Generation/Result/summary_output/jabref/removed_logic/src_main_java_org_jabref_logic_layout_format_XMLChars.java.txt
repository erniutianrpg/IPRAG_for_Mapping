The `XMLChars` class converts LaTeX-formatted text and special characters to their XML/HTML equivalents. It handles LaTeX commands (like {\^o} → ô), replaces ASCII characters (e.g., `<` → `&lt;`), and ensures proper XML escaping. The code processes text in stages: removing LaTeX commands, converting special characters, and handling forced replacements for non-printable or problematic ASCII codes. The result is XML-safe text with proper entity encoding.
