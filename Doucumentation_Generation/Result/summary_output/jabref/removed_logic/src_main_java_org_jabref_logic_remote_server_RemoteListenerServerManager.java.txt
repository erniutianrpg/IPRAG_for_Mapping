The `RemoteListenerServerManager` class manages the lifecycle of a `RemoteListenerServerThread` for handling remote messages. It provides methods to open a server port (`open`), start the server thread (`start`), and stop it (`stop`). The `openAndStart` method combines opening and starting. It checks if the server is open (`isOpen`) or not started before (`isNotStartedBefore`). Errors like port binding issues are logged. The class implements `AutoCloseable` to ensure proper resource cleanup. The server thread is managed via `JabRefExecutorService`.
