This code defines an `EntryBasedFetcher` interface that extends `WebFetcher`. Its purpose is to search web resources for bibliographic information to complete an existing `BibEntry`. The key method `performSearch()` takes a `BibEntry` as input and returns a list of matching entries, potentially throwing a `FetcherException`. It's designed to help enrich incomplete bibliographic entries with fetched data. (94 words)
