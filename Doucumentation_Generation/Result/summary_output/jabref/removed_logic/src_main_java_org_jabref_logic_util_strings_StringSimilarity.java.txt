The code implements string similarity comparison using the Levenshtein distance algorithm. It checks if two strings are similar by comparing their case-insensitive edit distance (converted to English lowercase) against a fixed threshold of 4. If the distance is â‰¤4, the strings are considered similar. The main method `isSimilar()` returns a boolean result, while `editDistanceIgnoreCase()` calculates the actual distance.
