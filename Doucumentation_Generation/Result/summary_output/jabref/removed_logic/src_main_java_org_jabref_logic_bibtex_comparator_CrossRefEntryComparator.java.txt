The `CrossRefEntryComparator` sorts BibTeX entries based on their 'crossref' fields. Entries with a 'crossref' field are considered smaller (sorted earlier) than those without, ensuring referenced entries appear after referring entries in the .bib file. If both entries either have or lack the field, they're considered equal (returns 0). Otherwise, the entry without 'crossref' is sorted later (returns 1), while the one with it is sorted earlier (returns -1).
