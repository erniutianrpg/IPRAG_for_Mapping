This code represents a `CitationStyle` class in JabRef that manages citation styles (CSL files). It provides functionality to:
1. Load styles from files or sources
2. Validate and parse XML-based CSL files
3. Discover available styles in a directory
4. Store style metadata (title, file path, source)
5. Provide a default IEEE style
6. Check file extensions for valid citation styles

The class handles style creation from both internal resources and external files, with methods for style discovery and validation. It maintains a list of available styles and ensures proper XML parsing of CSL files.
