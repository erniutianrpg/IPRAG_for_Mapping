The `CitaviXmlImporter` class is a Java importer for the Citavi XML reference management format. It extends `Importer` and implements `Parser` to handle Citavi XML files (typically zipped), extracting bibliographic data like authors, titles, keywords, and publishers. Key functionalities include:

1. **File Recognition**: Checks for Citavi XML format by scanning for "citaviexchangedata" in the file.
2. **Data Parsing**: Unmarshals XML into Java objects using JAXB, then converts Citavi references into BibTeX entries.
3. **Field Mapping**: Maps Citavi fields (e.g., authors, editors, keywords) to BibTeX fields, cleaning and formatting text (e.g., HTML to LaTeX).
4. **Type Conversion**: Converts Citavi reference types (e.g., "book section") to BibTeX entry types (e.g., `InBook`).
5. **Temporary File Handling**: Extracts XML from ZIP, handles UTF-8 BOM, and cleans up temp files.

The importer supports Citavi-specific features like knowledge items and quotation types, producing a `ParserResult` with BibTeX entries.
