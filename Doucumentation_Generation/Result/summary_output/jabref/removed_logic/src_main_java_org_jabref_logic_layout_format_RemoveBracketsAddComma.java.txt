This code defines a `RemoveBracketsAddComma` formatter that processes a string by:
1. Removing all curly braces `{` and `}`
2. Replacing every closing brace `}` with a comma `,`
3. Preserving all other characters unchanged

It's designed to clean up text by eliminating brackets while adding commas where closing brackets existed, typically used for formatting bibliography entries.
