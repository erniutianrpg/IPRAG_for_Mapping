This code implements a ResearchGate fetcher for JabRef that can:
1. Search for fulltext PDFs of academic papers using either title or DOI
2. Perform complex queries to retrieve BibTeX entries from ResearchGate
3. Convert search results into BibEntry objects
4. Handle errors and server unavailability gracefully

It uses web scraping (via Jsoup) to interact with ResearchGate and Google search, and implements three interfaces: FulltextFetcher, EntryBasedFetcher, and SearchBasedFetcher. The fetcher prioritizes title searches but falls back to DOI searches when needed.
