The `Backend52` class manages citation references in a LibreOffice/OpenOffice document for JabRef versions 5.2-5.4. It handles creating, reading, updating, and deleting citation groups using reference marks and custom document properties. Key functionalities include:

1. Storing citations as reference marks with encoded citation keys and types
2. Managing page info for citations (only supporting it for the last citation in a group)
3. Providing health checks for unused properties
4. Supporting operations like combining, removing, and retrieving citation groups
5. Maintaining synchronization between in-memory data and document storage

The class uses a specific encoding scheme (`Codec52`) and follows the `OODataModel.JabRef52` data model.
