The `GroupSerializer` class converts different types of group hierarchies (like `ExplicitGroup`, `KeywordGroup`, `SearchGroup`, etc.) into serialized string representations. It handles various group properties (name, hierarchy, search expressions, colors, icons) and formats them with separators and quotes. The `serializeTree` method recursively serializes a group tree structure into a list of strings, preserving the hierarchy. Each group type has its own serialization method, appending relevant details in a standardized format.
