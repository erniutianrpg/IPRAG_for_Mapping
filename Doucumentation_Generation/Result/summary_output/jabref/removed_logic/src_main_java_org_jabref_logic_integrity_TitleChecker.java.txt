The `TitleChecker` class validates whether titles in a bibliography (BibTeX) have capital letters that aren't properly masked with curly brackets `{}`. It removes text within curly brackets, splits the title by delimiters (., !, ?, ;, :), and checks each substring (ignoring the first character) for capital letters. If found, it returns a warning. The check is skipped for empty values or in Biblatex mode. This ensures titles follow proper capitalization formatting rules.
