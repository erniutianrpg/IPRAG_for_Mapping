The `ProtectedTermsList` class manages a list of protected terms (like sensitive words) with functionality to:
- Store terms, description, and location (file path)
- Check if the list is internal or enabled
- Add new terms to the file (appending or creating)
- Compare and equate lists based on description/location
- Handle file operations with error logging
- Prevent modifications to internal lists

It's essentially a file-backed container for protected terms with basic CRUD operations and state management.
