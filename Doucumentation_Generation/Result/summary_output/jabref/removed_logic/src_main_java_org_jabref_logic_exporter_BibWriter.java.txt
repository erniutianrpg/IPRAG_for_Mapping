The `BibWriter` class is a helper for writing to .bib files with controlled line endings. It wraps a `Writer` and ensures consistent newline handling (`newLineSeparator`). Key features:  
- `write()` outputs a string, converting its newlines to the specified format.  
- `writeLine()` appends a string followed by a newline.  
- `finishLine()` ensures the current line ends with a newline.  
- `finishBlock()` adds a newline if needed and marks the block as complete.  
It tracks writing state (`somethingWasWritten`, `lastWriteWasNewline`) to manage formatting.
