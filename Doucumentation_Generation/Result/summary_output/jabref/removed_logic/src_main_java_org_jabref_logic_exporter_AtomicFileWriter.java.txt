The `AtomicFileWriter` class extends `OutputStreamWriter` to provide atomic file writing using `AtomicFileOutputStream`, ensuring file integrity during write operations. It checks if the specified character encoding can encode all written text, collecting problematic characters in a set. Key features include: atomic writes (no partial file corruption), encoding validation, and retrieval of unsupported characters via `getEncodingProblems()`. It's useful for safe file operations with encoding checks.
