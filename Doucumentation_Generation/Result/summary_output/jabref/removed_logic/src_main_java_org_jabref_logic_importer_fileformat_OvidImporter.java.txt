The `OvidImporter` class is a Java importer for Ovid-formatted bibliographic data files. It extends `Importer` to parse Ovid text files into `BibEntry` objects. Key features include:

1. Recognizes Ovid files by checking for specific patterns (`<[0-9]+>`).
2. Parses entries using regex patterns to extract metadata like authors, titles, journals, years, and pages.
3. Handles different entry types (articles, books, incollections) and formats author names properly.
4. Processes fields like abstracts, keywords, ISSN, and DOI.
5. Converts parsed data into BibTeX-compatible format, adjusting page ranges and name formats.

The importer outputs a `ParserResult` containing a list of `BibEntry` objects ready for use in JabRef.
