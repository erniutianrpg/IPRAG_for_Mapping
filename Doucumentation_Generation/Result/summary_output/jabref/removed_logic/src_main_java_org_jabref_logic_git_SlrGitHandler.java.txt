The `SlrGitHandler` class extends `GitHandler` to manage Git operations for a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) repository. It provides functionality to:

1. Calculate diffs (patches) between the latest commit and its parent on a specified branch (`calculatePatchOfNewSearchResults`).
2. Parse these patches to extract added entries while ignoring study definition files (`parsePatchForAddedEntries`).
3. Apply the parsed patches to current branch files, preserving encoding information (`applyPatch`).
4. Commit the changes with a provided message (`appendLatestSearchResultsOntoCurrentBranch`).

The class focuses on managing search result updates in a structured way within a Git repository.
