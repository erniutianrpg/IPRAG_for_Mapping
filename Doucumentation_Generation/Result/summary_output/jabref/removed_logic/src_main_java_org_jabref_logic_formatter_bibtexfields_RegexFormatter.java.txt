The `RegexFormatter` class applies regular expression-based search and replace operations on BibTeX field values. It takes a regex pattern and replacement string as input, processes the text while protecting content within curly braces, handles escaped braces, and performs the substitution. Invalid regex patterns are logged as warnings. The formatter is part of the JabRef logic for cleaning and formatting BibTeX fields.
