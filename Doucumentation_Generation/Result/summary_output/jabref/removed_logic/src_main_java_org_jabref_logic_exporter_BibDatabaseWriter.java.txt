This code provides an abstract base class `BibDatabaseWriter` for writing bibliographic databases to files. Key functionalities include:

1. **Database Writing**: Saves database entries, strings, metadata, and preamble in a structured format.
2. **Sorting & Formatting**: Applies save actions (cleanup rules) and sorts entries based on metadata or preferences.
3. **Citation Keys**: Generates missing citation keys before saving if configured.
4. **Custom Types**: Handles custom entry type definitions for non-standard entry types.
5. **String References**: Manages string references to ensure correct BibTeX output order.

Subclasses (like `BibtexDatabaseWriter`) implement specific file format serialization. The code supports both full and partial database saves with configurable sorting and formatting.
