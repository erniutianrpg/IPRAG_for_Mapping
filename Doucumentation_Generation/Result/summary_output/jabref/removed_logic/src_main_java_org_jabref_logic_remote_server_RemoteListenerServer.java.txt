The `RemoteListenerServer` class implements a server that listens for remote messages on a specified port. It handles two types of messages: `PING` (responds with `PONG`) and `SEND_COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENTS` (forwards arguments to a message handler). The server runs in a loop until interrupted, managing socket connections with a timeout. It ensures proper socket cleanup upon termination. This enables remote communication for JabRef, likely for features like command-line argument passing between instances.
