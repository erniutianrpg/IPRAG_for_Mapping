The `AbbreviationFormat` class provides a utility method `getCSVFormat()` that configures and returns an Apache Commons CSV format with specific settings: semicolon delimiter, backslash escape, double-quote quote character, while ignoring empty lines and trimming entries. The class is uninstantiable (private constructor) and defines constants for these formatting characters. It's likely used for parsing journal abbreviation files in JabRef. (98 words)
