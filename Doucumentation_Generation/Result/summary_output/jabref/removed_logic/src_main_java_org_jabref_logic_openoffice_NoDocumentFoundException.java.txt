The `NoDocumentFoundException` is a custom exception class in Java that indicates when no OpenOffice Writer documents are found. It extends `Exception` and provides two constructors: one with a custom error message and a default one with the message "No Writer documents found". This exception is likely used in JabRef's OpenOffice integration to handle cases where expected documents are missing. (58 words)
