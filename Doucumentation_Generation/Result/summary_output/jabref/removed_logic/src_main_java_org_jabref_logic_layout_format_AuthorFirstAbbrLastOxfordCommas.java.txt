This code defines a `LayoutFormatter` implementation called `AuthorFirstAbbrLastOxfordCommas` that formats author names in a bibliography entry. It displays authors with abbreviated first names, followed by von and last names, separated by commas. For three or more authors, it adds an Oxford comma before the final "and". The formatting is delegated to `AuthorList.fixAuthorFirstNameFirstCommas()` with parameters to enable abbreviation and Oxford commas.
