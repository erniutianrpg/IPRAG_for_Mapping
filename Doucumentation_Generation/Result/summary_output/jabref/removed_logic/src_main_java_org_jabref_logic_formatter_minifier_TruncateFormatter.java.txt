The `TruncateFormatter` class truncates a string after a specified index and removes trailing whitespaces. It takes a truncation index in its constructor, defaulting to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` if negative. The `format` method shortens the input string to the given length (or keeps it if shorter) and strips trailing spaces. It also provides metadata like name, key, description, and example input for localization and documentation purposes. This is part of a larger text minification/formatting system.
