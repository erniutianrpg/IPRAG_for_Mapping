This code handles citation marker generation in a bibliography style for OpenOffice/LibreOffice. Key functionalities include:

1. Formatting author lists with configurable separators, max authors, and "et al" abbreviations
2. Generating citation markers in either parenthetical (Author, year) or in-text (Author (year)) formats
3. Handling page numbers and unique letters for disambiguation
4. Normalizing citations for comparison
5. Grouping consecutive citations with the same source
6. Supporting unresolved citations and various formatting options like italics, brackets, and separators

The code provides flexible citation formatting while handling edge cases like duplicate citations, missing fields, and disambiguation needs.
