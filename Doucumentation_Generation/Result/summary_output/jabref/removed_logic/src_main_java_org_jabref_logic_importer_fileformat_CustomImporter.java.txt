The `CustomImporter` class extends `Importer` to support loading and using custom importers dynamically. It takes a base path and class name, loads the specified class using a `URLClassLoader`, and delegates all importer operations (like format recognition, database import, and metadata retrieval) to the loaded importer instance. It also provides methods for equality checks, string representation, and accessing importer properties. Essentially, it acts as a wrapper for external importer implementations.
