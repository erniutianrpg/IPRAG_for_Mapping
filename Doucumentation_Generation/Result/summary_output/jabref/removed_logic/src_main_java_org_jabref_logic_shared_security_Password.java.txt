The `Password` class provides symmetric encryption and decryption of passwords using AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding. It takes a phrase and a key, generates a 128-bit hash from the key using SHA-256, and uses a fixed initialization vector (IV). The `encrypt()` method encrypts the phrase and returns a Base64-encoded string, while `decrypt()` reverses the process. The class ensures secure password handling with standard cryptographic practices.
