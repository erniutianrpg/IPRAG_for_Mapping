This code defines an abstract `Exporter` class for exporting bibliographic entries to files in JabRef. It provides:
1. Basic exporter properties (ID, name, file type)
2. Core export functionality (abstract method to be implemented by subclasses)
3. Two specialized export methods:
   - `exportToAllFilesOfEntry`: Exports entries to all linked files of a given entry
   - `exportToFileByPath`: Exports entries linked to a specific file path
The class handles file resolution and export operations while allowing custom export implementations.
