This code defines a `MarkdownFormatter` class that converts Markdown text to HTML. It uses the Flexmark library to parse the input Markdown string (`fieldText`) into an abstract syntax tree (AST), then renders it as HTML. The output HTML is modified to remove newlines, converting it into a single line of text. This formatter is part of a larger system (JabRef) for formatting bibliography fields, ensuring consistent output by handling null inputs and normalizing line breaks.
