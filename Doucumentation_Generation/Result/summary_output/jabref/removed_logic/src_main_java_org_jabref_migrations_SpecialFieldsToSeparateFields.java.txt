This code migrates special field values from keywords to separate fields in BibTeX entries. It checks for specific keywords (like "printed", "prio1", "qualityAssured", etc.) in each entry's keywords, and if found, moves them to corresponding special fields (like PRINTED, PRIORITY, QUALITY). The migration is based on a predefined mapping table. After migration, the original keywords are removed. This helps in better organization and standardization of special field values in bibliography entries.
