This code implements a fetcher for retrieving bibliographic data from mEDRA's API using DOIs (Digital Object Identifiers). The `Medra` class extends `IdBasedParserFetcher` to fetch entries by DOI, parse JSON responses, and convert them into `BibEntry` objects. It handles fields like title, authors, year, DOI, pages, ISSN, journal, publisher, URL, and volume. The fetcher sets the "Accept" header to request JSON data and performs post-cleanup on entries using `DoiCleanup`. It supports article and miscellaneous entry types, with error handling for JSON parsing.
