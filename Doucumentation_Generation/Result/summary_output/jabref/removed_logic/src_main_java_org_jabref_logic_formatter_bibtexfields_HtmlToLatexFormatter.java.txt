This Java class `HtmlToLatexFormatter` converts HTML text to LaTeX format. It handles HTML tags (like `<sup>` and `<sub>`), special characters (both text-based and numerical HTML entities), and combining accents, replacing them with their LaTeX equivalents. Unconverted characters are logged as warnings. The formatter skips HTML tags (up to 100 characters) and cleans up the output by removing redundant symbols like `$$`. It's part of the JabRef project for bibliography management.
