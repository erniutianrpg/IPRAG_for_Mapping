The `IEEEQueryTransformer` class transforms search queries into a format suitable for the IEEE Xplore API. It handles logical operators (AND, OR, NOT), author/title/journal fields, year ranges, and article numbers. It ignores common stopwords (e.g., "a", "and") and properly formats journal names with quotes if needed. The transformed query parameters can be retrieved via `getJournal()` and `getArticleNumber()`. This class extends `YearRangeByFilteringQueryTransformer` to support year-based filtering.
