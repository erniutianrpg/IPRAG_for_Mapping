The `DOAJFetcher` class implements a fetcher for the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) API. It searches for articles based on a Lucene query, processes the JSON response, and converts it into BibTeX entries. Key functionalities include:

1. Constructing API query URLs with search parameters.
2. Parsing JSON responses to extract bibliographic data (authors, titles, journals, etc.).
3. Converting the parsed data into `BibEntry` objects with proper field mappings.
4. Supporting keyword separation and handling various metadata fields like DOI, ISSN, and URLs.

The fetcher is integrated with JabRef's import system and handles up to 30 results per query.
