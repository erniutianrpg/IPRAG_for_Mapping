The `CleanupUrlFormatter` class cleans and decodes URL strings. It extracts URLs from parameters like "url=" or "to=" in complex links, then URL-decodes them while preserving plus signs by converting them to "%2b". The formatter ensures proper UTF-8 decoding and handles null inputs. It's part of a larger system (JabRef) for managing bibliography data, specifically for sanitizing URL fields in entries. The example shows it can simplify complex tracking URLs to their final destination.
