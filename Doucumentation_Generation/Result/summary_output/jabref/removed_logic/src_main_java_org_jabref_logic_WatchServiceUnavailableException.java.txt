This code defines a custom exception `WatchServiceUnavailableException` that extends `JabRefException`. It's used to indicate when a watch service (likely for file system monitoring) is unavailable. The exception accepts three parameters: a technical message, a user-friendly localized message, and a throwable cause, passing them to the parent class constructor. This provides structured error handling for watch service failures in the JabRef application. (49 words)
