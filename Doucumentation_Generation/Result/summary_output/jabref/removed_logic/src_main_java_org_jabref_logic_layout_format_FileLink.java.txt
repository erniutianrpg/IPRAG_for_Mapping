The `FileLink` class formats file links in JabRef entries. It selects the first file link from a parsed list, or a specific file type if specified via `setArgument()`. It searches for the file in provided directories (falling back to a main directory) and returns the normalized path if found, otherwise the raw link. Returns an empty string if no matching file is found.
