The `ClearFormatter` class is a BibTeX field formatter that completely clears any input string. It extends `Formatter` and overrides methods to return an empty string when formatting, with metadata (name, key, description, example) indicating its purpose is to erase field content. For any non-null input, `format()` returns an empty string.
