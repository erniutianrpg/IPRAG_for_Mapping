The `FulltextFetchers` class combines multiple `FulltextFetcher` instances to resolve URLs for full-text PDFs of academic articles. It first checks for a DOI in the provided `BibEntry`, fetches one if missing, then concurrently queries all fetchers with a 10-second timeout. Results are filtered to valid PDFs, sorted by fetcher trust level, and the highest-ranked URL is returned. The class handles errors gracefully and logs failures.
