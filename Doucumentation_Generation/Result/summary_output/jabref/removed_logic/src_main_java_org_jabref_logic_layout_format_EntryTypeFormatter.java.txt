This code formats BibTeX entry types by converting them to camel case with a leading capital letter. Known types (e.g., "inbook") are formatted to their standard display names ("InBook"), while unknown types (e.g., "banana") are simply capitalized ("Banana"). It implements a `LayoutFormatter` interface to transform the input string.
