This code defines a comparator (`CompareCitedKey`) for sorting citation keys in a bibliography. It compares two `ComparableCitedKey` objects, handling both resolved (with `BibEntry`) and unresolved (without `BibEntry`) citations. Unresolved citations can be configured to come first or last. If both are unresolved, it compares by citation key; if one is unresolved, it places it based on the configuration; otherwise, it uses the provided `BibEntry` comparator. The class is part of a citation style management system in JabRef. (98 words)
