The `RemoteClient` class enables communication with a remote JabRef instance over a specified port. It provides two main functions: `ping()` to check if a remote server is active and responding correctly, and `sendCommandLineArguments()` to forward command-line arguments to an already running JabRef instance. Both methods establish a socket connection with a timeout, send messages using a custom `Protocol` class, and handle responses or errors. The class logs errors if the port is unavailable or communication fails.
