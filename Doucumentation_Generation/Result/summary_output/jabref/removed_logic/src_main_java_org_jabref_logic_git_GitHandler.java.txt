The `GitHandler` class provides a simplified interface to manage Git repositories in Java. It initializes repositories, checks out branches, creates commits, merges branches, and handles push/pull operations. It uses JGit under the hood and supports credentials from environment variables. Key features include repository initialization with `.gitignore`, branch management, commit creation (with amend support), merging with configurable strategies, and remote operations (push/pull). The class handles basic Git workflows while logging errors silently.
