This code exports cited references from an OpenOffice document into a new BibTeX database. It:

1. Retrieves citation keys from an OpenOffice document
2. Looks them up in provided BibTeX databases
3. Creates a new database with cloned entries of found citations
4. Handles cross-references (adding referenced entries if found)
5. Tracks unresolved citation keys
6. Returns both the new database and any unresolved keys

The code handles document exceptions and maintains uniqueness of cross-referenced entries.
