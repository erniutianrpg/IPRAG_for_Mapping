The `RemoveRedundantSpacesFormatter` class is a BibTeX field formatter that replaces multiple consecutive spaces in a string with a single space. It uses a regular expression to match two or more spaces (`" {2,}"`) and replaces them with one space. The class provides metadata like name, key, description, and example input ("In   CDMA" becomes "In CDMA") for user interface integration. It's part of the JabRef logic for cleaning up BibTeX field contents.
