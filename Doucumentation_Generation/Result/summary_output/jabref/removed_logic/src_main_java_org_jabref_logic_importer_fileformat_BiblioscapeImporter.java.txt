This code implements an importer for Biblioscape Tag Files, converting them into BibTeX entries. It reads a text file line by line, parsing fields like author, title, year, etc., and maps them to corresponding BibTeX fields. Some Biblioscape fields are ignored or added as comments. The importer handles entry types (articles, books, etc.), concatenates pages/addresses, and processes folded lines. Entries are separated by "------" lines. The result is a list of BibTeX entries in JabRef's format.
