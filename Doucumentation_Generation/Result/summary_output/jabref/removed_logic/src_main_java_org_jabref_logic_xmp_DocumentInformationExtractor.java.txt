The `DocumentInformationExtractor` class extracts bibliographic metadata from a PDF's document information (PDDocumentInformation) and converts it into a `BibEntry` object. It maps standard PDF fields like author, title, keywords, and subject to corresponding BibTeX fields. Additionally, it processes custom fields prefixed with "bibtex/" to populate other BibTeX fields or the entry type. If no fields are found, it returns an empty `Optional`; otherwise, it returns the populated `BibEntry`. This facilitates extracting citation data from PDFs for reference management.
