This code defines a utility class `WebFetchers` that provides methods to retrieve different types of fetchers (search-based, ID-based, entry-based, full-text, etc.) for fetching bibliographic data from various online sources (arXiv, CrossRef, IEEE, etc.). The fetchers are organized by type and returned as sorted sets, with each method initializing and configuring the appropriate fetchers based on input preferences. The class supports fetching by identifiers (DOI, ISBN), fields, or customizable API keys.
