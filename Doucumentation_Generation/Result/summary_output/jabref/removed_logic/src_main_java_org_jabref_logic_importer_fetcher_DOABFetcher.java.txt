The `DOABFetcher` class fetches book metadata from the Directory of Open Access Books (DOAB) API. It constructs a query URL with parameters, processes the JSON response, and converts it into BibTeX entries. The fetcher handles author/editor names, ISBNs, titles, abstracts, and other bibliographic fields, with special handling for publisher information and keywords. It implements `SearchBasedParserFetcher` to search DOAB and parse results into structured `BibEntry` objects for JabRef.
