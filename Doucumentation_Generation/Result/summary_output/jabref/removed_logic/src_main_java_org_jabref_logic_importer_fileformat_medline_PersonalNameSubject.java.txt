The `PersonalNameSubject` record in Java defines an immutable data structure representing a person's name, specifically for use as a subject in MEDLINE (a biomedical literature database). It stores two fields: `lastName` (surname) and `foreName` (given name). As a record, it automatically provides implementations of `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` based on these fields, simplifying its use as a simple data carrier.
