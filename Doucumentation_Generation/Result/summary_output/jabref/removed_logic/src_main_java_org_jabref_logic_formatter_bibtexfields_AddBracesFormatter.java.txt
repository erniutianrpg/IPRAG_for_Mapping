The `AddBracesFormatter` class adds enclosing braces `{}` around a string if it doesn't already start with `{` and end with `}`. It's part of a BibTeX field formatting utility, ensuring consistent brace encapsulation for fields like titles. If the input is already braced or too short, it returns the original string. Example: "In CDMA" becomes "{In CDMA}".
