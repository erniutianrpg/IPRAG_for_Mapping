The `CleanupWorker` class performs various cleanup operations on BibTeX entries based on specified preferences. It takes a `CleanupPreferences` object to determine which cleanup actions (like DOI cleanup, PDF renaming, timestamp conversion, etc.) to apply to a `BibEntry`. Each action is handled by a specific `CleanupJob` implementation. The worker executes all active jobs sequentially and returns a list of `FieldChange` objects documenting modifications made to the entry. The cleanup actions are configurable and include file path adjustments, format conversions, and field normalizations.
