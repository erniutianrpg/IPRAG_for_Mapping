This code implements an ISBN fetcher that queries the `doi-to-bibtex-converter.herokuapp.com` API to convert ISBNs into BibTeX entries. It validates the ISBN, constructs the API URL, processes the JSON response, and maps the data to a `BibEntry` object with fields like title, author, year, etc. Error handling is included for invalid responses. The fetcher defaults to `Book` entry type if the type isn't specified. It's part of the JabRef reference management software for importing bibliographic data.
