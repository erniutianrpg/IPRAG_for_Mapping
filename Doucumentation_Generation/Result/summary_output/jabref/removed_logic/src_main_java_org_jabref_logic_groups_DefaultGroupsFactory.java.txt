The `DefaultGroupsFactory` class provides a static method `getAllEntriesGroup()` that creates and returns an `AllEntriesGroup` instance with a default name ("All entries") and icon. The class cannot be instantiated (private constructor) and serves as a utility for creating a predefined group containing all entries in JabRef. The icon name is stored as a constant. (60 words)
