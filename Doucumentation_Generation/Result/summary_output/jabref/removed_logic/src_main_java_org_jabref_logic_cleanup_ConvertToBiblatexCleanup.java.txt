This code converts a BibTeX entry to Biblatex format by:
1. Renaming fields using predefined aliases (e.g., "journal" to "journaltitle") if the new field is empty
2. Handling date fields by combining year and month into a single date field (if date field is empty) or removing redundant year/month fields when they match the date field
3. Tracking and returning all field changes made during conversion

The cleanup preserves existing data while updating the format, focusing on Biblatex-specific field names and date handling conventions.
