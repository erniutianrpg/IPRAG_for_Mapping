This code defines a `GroupNodeViewModel` class that represents a view model for group nodes in JabRef's group hierarchy. It handles:
- Group display names and icons
- Managing child groups
- Tracking matched BibTeX entries
- Group expansion/collapse state
- Drag-and-drop operations for moving groups
- Adding entries to groups
- Synchronizing with database changes
- UI bindings for selection states and hit counts

The class acts as an intermediary between the group tree data structure and the JavaFX UI, providing observable properties and handling user interactions.
