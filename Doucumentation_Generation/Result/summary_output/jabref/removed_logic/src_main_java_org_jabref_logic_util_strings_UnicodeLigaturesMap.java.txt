The `UnicodeLigaturesMap` class is a specialized `HashMap` that maps Unicode ligature characters to their corresponding two-letter combinations (e.g., "Æ" to "AE"). It provides a bijective mapping for Latin alphabet ligatures, allowing conversion between ligatures and expanded forms. The map includes common typographic ligatures (like "ff", "fi") and some phonetic transcriptions. Notably, it excludes the German "ß" character. The mapping can be reversed if needed.
