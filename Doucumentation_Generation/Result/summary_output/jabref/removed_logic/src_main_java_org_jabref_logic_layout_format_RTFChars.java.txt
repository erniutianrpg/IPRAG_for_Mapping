This code converts LaTeX-formatted text to RTF (Rich Text Format). It handles several tasks: removing LaTeX commands, replacing LaTeX special characters with RTF equivalents, converting text formatting (like \emph, \textit, \textbf) to RTF styles (italic, bold), preserving Unicode characters by encoding them properly, and replacing specific LaTeX sequences (---, --, ``, '') with RTF equivalents (emdash, endash, quotes). The transformation involves parsing the input string character-by-character, handling commands and special cases, and building the RTF output accordingly.
