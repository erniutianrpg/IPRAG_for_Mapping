The `EntryAnnotationImporter` class scans PDF files attached to a BibEntry for annotations. It filters out non-PDF and online files, then uses a `PdfAnnotationImporter` to extract annotations from each valid file. The results are returned as a map linking each PDF file path to its list of annotations. This functionality aids in managing annotations within a bibliography database context.
