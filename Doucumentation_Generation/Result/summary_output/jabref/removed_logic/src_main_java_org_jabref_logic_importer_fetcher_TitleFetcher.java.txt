The `TitleFetcher` class is an identifier-based fetcher that retrieves bibliographic entries by title. It first checks if the provided title is valid, creates a temporary `BibEntry` with the title, then attempts to find a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) associated with that title. If a DOI is found, it delegates the actual fetching to a `DoiFetcher` to retrieve the full bibliographic details. This fetcher is part of JabRef's logic for importing references.
