The `BstTextPrefixer` class provides a method `textPrefix` that extracts a prefix of a given string, treating special characters (like accented letters) enclosed in braces as single characters. It takes an integer `numOfChars` and a string, then returns the first `numOfChars` characters, counting braced sequences as one character. It ensures balanced braces by appending missing closing braces. Unbalanced braces trigger a warning. This is useful for BibTeX style processing where special characters need special handling.
