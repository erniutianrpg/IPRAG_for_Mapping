This code provides mapping functionality between MSBib (Microsoft's bibliography format) and BibTeX/biblatex formats. It includes:

1. Bidirectional field mappings between BibTeX/biblatex and MSBib fields
2. Language to LCID (Locale ID) conversions and vice versa
3. Entry type conversions between MSBib and BibTeX/biblatex types
4. Utility methods to translate between formats for fields, entry types, and languages

The class uses bidirectional maps for efficient lookups in both directions and provides default values when exact matches aren't found.
