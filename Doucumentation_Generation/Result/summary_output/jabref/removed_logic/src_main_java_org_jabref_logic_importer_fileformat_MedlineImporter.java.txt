The `MedlineImporter` class is an XML parser that imports bibliographic data from Medline/PubMed format into BibTeX entries. It handles PubMed articles and book articles, extracting metadata like titles, authors, abstracts, keywords, publication dates, and other relevant fields. The parser processes XML elements recursively, converts Medline-specific formats (like page ranges), and maps them to BibTeX fields. It also handles special cases like multiple authors, investigators, and chemical lists. The importer ensures data integrity and provides error handling for XML parsing issues.
