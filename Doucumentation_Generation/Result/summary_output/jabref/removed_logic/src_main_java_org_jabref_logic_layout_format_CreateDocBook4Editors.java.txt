This code defines a `CreateDocBook4Editors` class that formats a list of editors into DocBook4 XML format. It takes a string of editor names, parses them into an `AuthorList`, then uses a `DocBookAuthorFormatter` to convert each name into XML elements (`<editor><firstname>...</firstname><surname>...</surname></editor>`). The result is returned as a concatenated string of all formatted editor entries.
