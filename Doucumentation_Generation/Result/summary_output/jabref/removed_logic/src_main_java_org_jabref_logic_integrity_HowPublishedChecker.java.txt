The `HowPublishedChecker` class checks if the "HowPublished" field in a BibTeX entry follows formatting rules. For BibTeX (not biblatex), it verifies that the first letter of the value is capitalized. If not, it returns an error message. Blank values pass automatically. The check aligns with BibTeX specifications, which require capitalization, while biblatex handles capitalization automatically.
