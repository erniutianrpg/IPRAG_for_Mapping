This code defines an `AuthorLastFirstAbbreviator` class that abbreviates author names in "Last, First" format (e.g., "Someone, Van Something" becomes "Someone, V.S."). It implements the `LayoutFormatter` interface and delegates the actual formatting to an `AuthorAbbreviator` class, making it a convenience wrapper for that functionality.
