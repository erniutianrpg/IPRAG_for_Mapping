The `Parser` interface defines a contract for converting input data into a list of `BibEntry` objects. It provides two methods: `parseEntries(InputStream)` for parsing from an input stream, and a default `parseEntries(String)` that converts a string to an input stream (UTF-8 encoded) and delegates to the first method. Implementations of this interface handle parsing bibliographic data from various formats.
