The `CitationStyleGenerator` class provides a facade for generating citations in various styles using the CSL (Citation Style Language) engine. It offers methods to generate citations for single or multiple `BibEntry` objects in different output formats (e.g., HTML). The class handles errors like invalid styles or malformed entries, returning user-friendly error messages. Citations are generated asynchronously (recommended outside the main thread) via a `CSLAdapter`. Key functionalities include style-based citation rendering and error handling for bad input.
