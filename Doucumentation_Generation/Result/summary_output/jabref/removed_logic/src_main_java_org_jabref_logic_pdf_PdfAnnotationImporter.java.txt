This code imports annotations (comments, highlights, etc.) from a PDF file. It validates the file path, loads the PDF using Apache PDFBox, then extracts supported annotations (excluding links and widgets). For marked annotations (like highlights), it extracts the associated text. The results are returned as a list of `FileAnnotation` objects containing annotation details (type, content, page number). Unsupported files or annotations are skipped, with errors logged.
