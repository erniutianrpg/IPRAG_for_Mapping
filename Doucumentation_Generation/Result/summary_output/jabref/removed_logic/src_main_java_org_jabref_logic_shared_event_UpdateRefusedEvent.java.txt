The `UpdateRefusedEvent` class represents an event triggered when a user attempts to push changes to an outdated `BibEntry` to a server. It stores the affected database context (`BibDatabaseContext`), the local entry (`localBibEntry`), and the shared entry (`sharedBibEntry`). The class provides getter methods to access these fields. This event serves as a notification mechanism for synchronization conflicts in a shared database environment. (94 words)
