The `Protocol` class handles communication between JabRef instances over a socket connection. It sends and receives messages of type `RemoteMessage`, which can include arguments. Special handling is implemented for command-line arguments (URL encoding/decoding). Each message is terminated with '\0'. The class manages socket I/O streams and ensures proper resource cleanup via `AutoCloseable`. Error handling includes logging for stream/socket closure failures. The protocol supports different message types and ensures correct message termination.
