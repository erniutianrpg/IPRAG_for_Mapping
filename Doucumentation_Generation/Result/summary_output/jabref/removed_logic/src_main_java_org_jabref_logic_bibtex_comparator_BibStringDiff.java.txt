The `BibStringDiff` class compares BibTeX string entries between two databases (`originalDatabase` and `newDatabase`). It identifies differences by checking for: 
1. Name matches with content changes, 
2. Content matches with name changes (renamed strings), 
3. Removed strings (present only in original), and 
4. Added strings (present only in new). 
The results are returned as a list of `BibStringDiff` objects, each representing a change (original vs new string). The class also includes standard `equals` and `hashCode` methods for comparison.
