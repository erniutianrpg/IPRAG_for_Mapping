The `UnprotectTermsFormatter` class removes balanced curly braces `{}` from around words in a given string. It tracks brace levels to ensure only balanced pairs are removed, returning the original text if braces are unbalanced. For example, `{In} {CDMA}` becomes `In CDMA`. Unbalanced braces leave the text unchanged. This formatter is part of a text cleanup utility, with methods for description, example input, name, and key.
