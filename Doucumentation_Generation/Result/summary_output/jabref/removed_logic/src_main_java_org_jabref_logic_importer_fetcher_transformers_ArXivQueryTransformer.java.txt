The `ArXivQueryTransformer` class extends `YearRangeByFilteringQueryTransformer` to convert search queries into a format suitable for the arXiv API. It maps author, title, journal, and unfielded terms to arXiv's search syntax (e.g., `au:` for authors, `ti:` for titles). It also handles logical operators (`AND`, `OR`, `ANDNOT`) and tracks year ranges for filtering. Unfielded terms are mapped to a general `all:` field. The class ensures queries are properly structured for arXiv's search parameters.
