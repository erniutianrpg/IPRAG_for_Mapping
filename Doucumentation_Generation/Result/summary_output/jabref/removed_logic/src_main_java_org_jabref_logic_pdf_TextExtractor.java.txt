The `TextExtractor` class extracts text from marked annotations (like highlights or underlines) in PDF documents. It takes a PDF page and bounding box coordinates as input, processes each segment of the annotation to calculate its bounding box, and uses PDFBox's `PDFTextStripperByArea` to extract the text within those regions. The extracted text from all segments is concatenated and returned as a trimmed string. The class handles coordinate conversion and page dimensions adjustments.
