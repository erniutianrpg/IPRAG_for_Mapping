The `RangeForOverlapCheck` class represents a protected text range in OpenOffice for overlap detection. It stores the range (`XTextRange`), a kind identifier (e.g., reference mark, footnote), an ID within its kind, and a user-friendly description. The class provides methods to retrieve the range (`getRange()`) and format the description (`format()`). It helps ensure protected ranges (like citations or footnotes) don't overlap by organizing them for validation and reporting.
