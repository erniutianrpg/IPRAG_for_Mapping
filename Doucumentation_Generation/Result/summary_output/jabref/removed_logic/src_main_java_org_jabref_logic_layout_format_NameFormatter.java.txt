The `NameFormatter` class formats author names in BibTeX style using flexible patterns. It accepts a parameter string specifying different formatting rules based on the number of authors and their positions (e.g., "{ll}, {f}." for "Doe, J."). The formatter handles cases, ranges, and custom formats for individual authors or groups. It can abbreviate names, join parts (von, first, last, jr), and apply different formats to different author ranges. The default format is `DEFAULT_FORMAT`, but custom formats can be set. The class also includes utility methods to manage name formatters from preferences.
