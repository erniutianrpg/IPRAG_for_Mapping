The `TrustLevel` enum defines different levels of trustworthiness for data sources in JabRef, each assigned a numerical score (3 being highest, 0 unknown). It includes levels like SOURCE, PUBLISHER, PREPRINT, META_SEARCH, and UNKNOWN, with a method `getTrustScore()` to retrieve the score. This helps prioritize or validate sources based on their trust level.
