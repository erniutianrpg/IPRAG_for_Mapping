The `PreviewLayout` interface defines methods for generating and managing previews of bibliography entries (`BibEntry`) in a UI. Key functionalities include:  
- `generatePreview()`: Renders an entry's preview using the provided database context.  
- `getDisplayName()`/`getName()`: Returns the layout's display/internal names.  
- `containsCaseIndependent()`: Checks if the display name contains a search term (case-insensitive).  

It serves as a base for rendering formatted entry previews, historically referred to as "layout" in JabRef. (98 words)
