The `MarcXmlParser` class is a parser for the Bavarian MARC XML standard, converting bibliographic records into BibTeX entries. It processes XML input to extract metadata like ISBN, authors, titles, publication details, physical descriptions, series info, summaries, keywords, DOIs, electronic locations, and notes. The parser handles various MARC tags (e.g., 020 for ISBN, 245 for title) and maps them to corresponding BibTeX fields. It also manages edge cases like malformed data and concatenates multi-value fields. The output is a list of `BibEntry` objects ready for use in JabRef.
