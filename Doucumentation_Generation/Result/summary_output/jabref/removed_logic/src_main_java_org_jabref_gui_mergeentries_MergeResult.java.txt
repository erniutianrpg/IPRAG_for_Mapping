The `MergeResult` class is a simple Java record that holds three `BibEntry` objects: `leftEntry`, `rightEntry`, and `mergedEntry`. It serves as a container for the results of a merge operation between two BibTeX entries (`leftEntry` and `rightEntry`), storing the original entries and the resulting merged entry (`mergedEntry`). Records automatically provide immutable data storage with built-in methods like `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()`.
