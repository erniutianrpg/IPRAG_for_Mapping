This JavaFX component provides a UI panel for configuring save order preferences in JabRef. It offers three radio buttons for choosing between original order, table order, or custom-specified order. When custom order is selected, users can add, remove, and reorder sort criteria (field + ascending/descending) in a grid. The panel manages these criteria through a ViewModel, synchronizing UI changes with the underlying data model. It includes features like row numbering, field dropdowns, move up/down buttons, and a criteria limit option.
