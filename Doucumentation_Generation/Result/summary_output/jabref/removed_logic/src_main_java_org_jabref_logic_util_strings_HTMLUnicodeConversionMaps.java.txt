This code defines conversion maps between HTML entities, Unicode characters, and LaTeX commands. It provides static mappings for:

1. HTML entities to LaTeX commands (HTML_LATEX_CONVERSION_MAP)
2. LaTeX commands to HTML entities (LATEX_HTML_CONVERSION_MAP) 
3. Unicode code points to LaTeX (NUMERICAL_LATEX_CONVERSION_MAP)
4. Unicode symbols to LaTeX (UNICODE_LATEX_CONVERSION_MAP)
5. LaTeX to Unicode symbols (LATEX_UNICODE_CONVERSION_MAP)

The mappings cover special characters, mathematical symbols, Greek letters, and diacritical marks. The static initializer populates these maps from predefined conversion tables (CONVERSION_LIST and ACCENT_LIST). The class serves as a utility for converting between these different character representations.
