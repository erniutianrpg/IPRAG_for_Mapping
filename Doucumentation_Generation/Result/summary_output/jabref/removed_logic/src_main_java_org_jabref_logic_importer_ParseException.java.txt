The `ParseException` class is a custom exception in Java that extends `Exception`. It provides three constructors to handle different error scenarios: 
1. Wrapping another throwable cause, 
2. Combining a custom message with a cause, and 
3. Using just a custom message. 
This exception is typically used to indicate errors during parsing operations in the JabRef application.
