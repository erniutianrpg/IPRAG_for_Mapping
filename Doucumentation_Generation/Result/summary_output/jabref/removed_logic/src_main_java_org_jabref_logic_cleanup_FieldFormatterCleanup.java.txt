The `FieldFormatterCleanup` class applies a formatter to specified fields in a BibTeX entry. It can clean up a single field, all fields (except the citation key), or all text fields. The formatter modifies the field's value, and if the result is empty, the field is removed. Changes are tracked and returned as `FieldChange` objects. The class also includes standard `equals`, `hashCode`, and `toString` methods.
