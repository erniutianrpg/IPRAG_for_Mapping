The `HTMLCharacterChecker` class checks BibTeX entries for HTML-encoded characters (like `&amp;`) in non-verbatim fields. It iterates through each field of a `BibEntry`, skips verbatim fields, and uses a regex pattern to detect HTML encodings. If found, it adds an integrity warning message. The result is a list of warnings for fields containing HTML characters.
