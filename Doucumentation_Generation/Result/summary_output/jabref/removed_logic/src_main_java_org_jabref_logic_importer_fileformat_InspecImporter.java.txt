The `InspecImporter` class is a Java importer for the INSPEC bibliographic format. It extends `Importer` to parse INSPEC-formatted text files into BibTeX entries. Key features include:

1. Recognizes INSPEC files by checking for "Record INSPEC" patterns
2. Parses fields like title (TI), year (PY), authors (AU), abstract (AB), keywords (ID), and journal info (SO)
3. Maps INSPEC entry types (RT) to BibTeX types (Article/InProceedings)
4. Processes author names and journal metadata into standard BibTeX format
5. Returns parsed entries as a `ParserResult` containing `BibEntry` objects

The importer handles text files (.txt) and transforms INSPEC's field-based format into structured BibTeX entries.
