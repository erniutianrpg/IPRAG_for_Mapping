The `TitleCaseFormatter` converts text to title case by capitalizing most words while keeping articles, prepositions, and conjunctions lowercase. It ensures the first and last words are always capitalized and preserves words starting with "{". Words following a colon are also capitalized. For example, "{BPMN} conformance in open source Engines" becomes "{BPMN} Conformance in Open Source Engines". The formatter is part of JabRef's text formatting utilities.
