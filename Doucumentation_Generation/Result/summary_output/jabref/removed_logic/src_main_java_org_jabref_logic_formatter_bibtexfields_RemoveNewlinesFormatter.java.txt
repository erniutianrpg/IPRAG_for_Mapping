The `RemoveNewlinesFormatter` class is a BibTeX field formatter that removes all line breaks from a given string. It replaces any line breaks (matched by the regex pattern `\\R`) with spaces and trims the result. The class provides metadata like name, key, description, and example input ("In \n CDMA" becomes "In CDMA") for localization and documentation purposes. It extends the `Formatter` abstract class from JabRef's logic.cleanup package.
