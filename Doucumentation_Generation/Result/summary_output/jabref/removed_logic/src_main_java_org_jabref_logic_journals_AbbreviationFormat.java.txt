The `AbbreviationFormat` class provides a utility method `getCSVFormat()` that configures and returns a `CSVFormat` object with specific settings: semicolon (`;`) as delimiter, backslash (`\`) as escape character, double quotes (`"`) for quoting, while ignoring empty lines and trimming values. The class is uninstantiable (private constructor) and serves as a helper for CSV formatting in journal abbreviation handling. (97 words)
