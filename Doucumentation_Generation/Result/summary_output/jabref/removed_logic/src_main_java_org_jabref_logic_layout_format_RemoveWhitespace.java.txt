This code defines a `RemoveWhitespace` class that implements a `LayoutFormatter` interface. Its `format` method takes a string input and removes all whitespace characters except for space characters (`' '`). It processes each character, appending it to the result only if it's not whitespace or if it's a space character. The formatted string is returned without most whitespace (like tabs, newlines) while preserving regular spaces. Returns `null` if the input is `null`.
