The `FieldComparator` class compares `BibEntry` objects based on specified fields for sorting in BibTeX entries. It handles different field types (names, types, years, months, and others) with special sorting rules, such as author names by last name and numeric fields by value. The comparator supports both ascending and descending order and uses locale-aware string comparison for text fields. Null values are sorted last, and numeric fields are parsed for proper numerical comparison. The multiplier adjusts the sort direction based on the `descending` flag.
