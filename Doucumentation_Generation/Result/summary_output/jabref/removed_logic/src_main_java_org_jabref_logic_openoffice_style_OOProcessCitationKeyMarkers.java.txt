This code generates citation markers in OpenOffice documents by joining citation keys with commas. It processes citation groups, sorts them in a bibliography, and formats each group with specified markup before and after the keys. The markers are set as text for each citation group, using the citation keys directly when the style configuration (`isCitationKeyCiteMarkers`) is enabled. The output is a simple comma-separated list of keys wrapped in style-specific markup.
