The `IfPlural` class is a formatter that checks if a field text contains multiple items (detected by the presence of "and"). If it does, it returns the first provided argument (plural form); otherwise, it returns the second argument (singular form). For example, it can format "Eds." for multiple editors or "Ed." for a single editor. The formatter takes two arguments during initialization and applies the logic during formatting.
