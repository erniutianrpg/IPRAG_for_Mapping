The `UndoRedoEvent` class extends `UndoChangeEvent` and represents an event triggered when an undo or redo action occurs. It stores information about whether undo/redo is possible (`canUndo`, `canRedo`) and their corresponding descriptions (`undoDescription`, `redoDescription`). This event is used to notify listeners about undo/redo state changes in the application. (50 words)
