This code provides functionality to open and load a BibTeX database file. It uses `BibtexImporter` to parse the file and then applies several post-open migrations (like converting legacy groups and special fields) to update the database structure. The result is returned as a `ParserResult` object. The migrations include handling explicit groups, markings, and special fields conversion. The class is utility-style with a private constructor and static methods.
