This code defines a `LatexToUnicodeFormatter` class that converts LaTeX character sequences (like `\"{o}`) to their Unicode equivalents (like "รถ") while stripping unhandled LaTeX commands. It implements `Formatter` and `LayoutFormatter` interfaces, providing methods for name, key, description, example input, and the core formatting function which delegates to `LatexToUnicodeAdapter.format()`. Essentially, it transforms LaTeX-encoded text into readable Unicode characters.
