The `ApsFetcher` class is a full-text fetcher for the APS (American Physical Society) journals. It attempts to find a PDF URL for a given `BibEntry` by extracting its DOI, converting it to an APS-specific ID, and checking if a PDF exists at APS's predefined URL. If found, it returns the PDF URL; otherwise, it returns empty. The fetcher uses DOI.org to resolve case-sensitive DOI formatting required by APS and verifies PDF availability via an HTTP HEAD request. It's marked with `TrustLevel.PUBLISHER` as it directly accesses APS's official site.
