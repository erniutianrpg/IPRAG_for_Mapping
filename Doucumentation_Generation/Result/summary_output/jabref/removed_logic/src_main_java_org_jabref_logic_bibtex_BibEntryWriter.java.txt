The `BibEntryWriter` class serializes BibTeX entries into formatted strings. It handles writing BibEntry objects to a BibWriter, organizing fields by required, optional, and remaining fields, and formatting them consistently. Key features include preserving user comments, maintaining field order, aligning field names, and handling invalid field values. It supports both BibTeX and BibLaTeX formats and avoids reformatting unchanged entries. The output is structured with proper indentation and line breaks.
