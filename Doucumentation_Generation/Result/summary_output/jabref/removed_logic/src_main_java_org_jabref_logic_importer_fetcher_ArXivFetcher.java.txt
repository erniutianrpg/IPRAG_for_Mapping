The `ArXivFetcher` class is a Java implementation for fetching and enhancing bibliographic entries from arXiv, a preprint repository. It extends basic arXiv metadata with DOI-based information from both arXiv-issued and user-provided DOIs to enrich entries with additional fields like keywords, authors, and publishers. The fetcher performs asynchronous API calls, merges data from multiple sources, and handles post-processing like keyword normalization. It supports fulltext fetching, paged searches, and identifier-based lookups while maintaining data integrity through field prioritization during merges.
