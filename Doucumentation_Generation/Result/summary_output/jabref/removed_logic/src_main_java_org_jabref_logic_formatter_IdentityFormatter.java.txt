The `IdentityFormatter` class is a no-operation formatter that implements the `Formatter` interface. It returns the input string unchanged in its `format` method, serves as a fallback option, and provides basic metadata like name ("Identity"), key ("identity"), description ("Does nothing"), and an example input ("JabRef"). It essentially performs no transformation on the input.
