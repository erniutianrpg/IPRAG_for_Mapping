This code defines a `LayoutFormatter` that formats author names in a bibliography entry with: last names first (including 'von' prefixes), followed by suffixes (jr) and first names (unabbreviated). Authors are separated by commas, using an Oxford comma (comma before 'and') for lists of three or more authors. It delegates the formatting to `AuthorList.fixAuthorLastNameFirstCommas(fieldText, false, true)`.
