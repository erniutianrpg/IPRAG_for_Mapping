This code implements a fetcher for CiteSeerX, a scientific literature database. It constructs search queries via URL parameters, extracts bibliographic data from HTML responses using COinS metadata embedded in `<span>` tags, and performs post-processing cleanup. The cleanup includes converting HTML-escaped characters to Unicode and formatting titles from all-caps to title case. The fetcher integrates with JabRef's import system to retrieve and parse entries from CiteSeerX.
