The `BibtexParser` class is a Java implementation for parsing BibTeX files. It reads BibTeX entries (articles, books, etc.), strings, comments, and metadata from an input stream or string. Key features include:

- Parses BibTeX entries with fields, handles string concatenation, and manages citations keys
- Supports BibTeX-specific syntax like `@string` definitions, `@preamble`, and comments
- Handles metadata and custom entry types in JabRef-specific formats
- Maintains line numbers for error reporting and preserves original formatting
- Robust error handling with warnings for malformed entries
- Processes both curly brace `{}` and parenthesis `()` delimiters

The parser works character-by-character with lookahead and pushback capabilities to handle complex BibTeX syntax.
