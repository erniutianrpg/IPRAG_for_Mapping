The `LayoutFormatterBasedFormatter` class adapts a `LayoutFormatter` to work as a `Formatter` by delegating all method calls to the wrapped `LayoutFormatter`. It provides the same name, key, description, and example input (all returning the class name of the wrapped formatter) and formats values using the wrapped formatter's `format` method. This enables using `LayoutFormatter` instances where `Formatter` is required, such as in field cleanup operations. (98 words)
