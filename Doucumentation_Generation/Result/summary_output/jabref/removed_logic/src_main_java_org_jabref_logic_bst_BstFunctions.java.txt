This code implements a BibTeX style language (BST) interpreter, providing built-in functions for processing bibliographic data. The `BstFunctions` class defines operations like string manipulation (`change.case$`, `substring$`), math operations (`+`, `-`), logical comparisons (`>`, `=`), name formatting (`format.name$`), and output handling (`write$`). It maintains a stack for operations and supports variables, conditionals, loops, and warnings. The functions interact with a BibTeX database to format citations according to BST rules, handling tasks like case conversion, punctuation, and special character processing.
