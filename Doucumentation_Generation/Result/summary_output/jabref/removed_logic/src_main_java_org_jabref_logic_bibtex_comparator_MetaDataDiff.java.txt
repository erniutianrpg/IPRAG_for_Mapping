The `MetaDataDiff` class compares two `MetaData` objects (from JabRef) and identifies differences between them. It checks various metadata attributes (like protection status, groups, encoding, file directories, etc.) and returns an `EnumSet` of `Difference` values indicating which fields changed. The class also provides optional `GroupDiff` for group-specific changes. The comparison is performed via the static `compare` method, which returns an empty `Optional` if metadata are identical. This is useful for detecting changes in bibliography metadata.
