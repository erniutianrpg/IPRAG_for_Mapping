The `FileUtil` class provides utility methods for file operations, including handling file extensions (getting/adding), validating filenames, copying files, finding files in directories, converting between absolute/relative paths, and detecting illegal characters in filenames. It also supports operations specific to bibliography files (BibTeX) and PDFs, as well as generating filenames/directory names from patterns. The class ensures cross-platform compatibility and handles edge cases like path relativization and unique path identification.
