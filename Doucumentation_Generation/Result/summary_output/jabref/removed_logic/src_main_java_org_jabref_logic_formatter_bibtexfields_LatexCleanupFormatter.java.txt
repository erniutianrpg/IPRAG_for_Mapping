The `LatexCleanupFormatter` class simplifies LaTeX syntax in BibTeX fields by:
1. Removing redundant braces and dollar signs while preserving LaTeX commands
2. Moving numbers and operators into equations
3. Replacing dollar signs with placeholders and restoring them selectively
4. Escaping percent signs (unless already escaped)
5. Cleaning up double spaces and empty math environments

It's part of JabRef's logic to clean up and standardize LaTeX code in bibliography entries.
