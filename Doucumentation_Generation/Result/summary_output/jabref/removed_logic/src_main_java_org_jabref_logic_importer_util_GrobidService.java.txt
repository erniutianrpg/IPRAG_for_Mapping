The `GrobidService` class provides an API to interact with a GROBID server for converting citations and PDF documents into BibTeX entries. It offers two main methods: `processCitation` (converts a raw citation string to a BibEntry) and `processPDF` (extracts BibEntries from a PDF file). Both methods send HTTP requests to the GROBID server, handle responses, and parse the results into BibTeX format using `BibtexParser`. The class requires GROBID to be enabled and configured via `GrobidPreferences`. Error handling includes checking for empty responses and invalid entries.
