This code defines an abstract `Importer` class for JabRef, a reference management software. It provides core functionality for importing bibliographic databases from various sources (files, strings, streams). Key features include:

1. Format recognition (`isRecognizedFormat`) to check if input matches the importer's expected format
2. Database import methods (`importDatabase`) that parse input into JabRef's internal format
3. Character encoding detection using ICU library
4. Basic importer metadata (name, ID, description, file type)
5. Standard Java object methods (equals, hashCode, compareTo)

The class serves as a base for specific format importers to extend, handling common import tasks while allowing format-specific implementations.
