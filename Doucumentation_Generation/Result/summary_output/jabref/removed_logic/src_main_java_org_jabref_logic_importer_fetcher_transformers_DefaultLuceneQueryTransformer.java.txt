The `DefaultLuceneQueryTransformer` class extends `AbstractQueryTransformer` to convert search queries into Lucene-compatible query strings. It defines logical operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`) and methods to format specific search fields (author, title, journal, year) as key-value pairs (e.g., `author:Einstein`). This enables structured searches in Lucene-based systems. The class serves as a basic transformer for bibliographic data queries. (98 words)
