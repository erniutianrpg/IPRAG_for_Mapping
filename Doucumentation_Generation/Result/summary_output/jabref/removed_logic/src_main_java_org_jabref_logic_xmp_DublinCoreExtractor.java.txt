The `DublinCoreExtractor` class facilitates bidirectional conversion between BibTeX entries and Dublin Core metadata (XMP). It extracts Dublin Core fields (e.g., title, author, date) into a `BibEntry` object and vice versa, handling standard mappings (e.g., `dc:creator` to BibTeX `author`) and custom fields (stored in `dc:relation`). Privacy filters and special cases (e.g., file fields) are respected during conversion. The class ensures compatibility between bibliographic data formats while preserving metadata integrity.
