This code implements a `LayoutFormatter` to format author names in Natbib style: it displays only last names, separates two authors with "and", and shows "et al." for three or more authors. The `format` method delegates the formatting to `AuthorList.fixAuthorNatbib()`, which handles the actual conversion of the input author list string.
