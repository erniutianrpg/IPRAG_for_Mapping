The `MrDLibFetcher` class fetches academic paper recommendations from the Mr. DLib service based on a given BibEntry's title. It constructs a query URL with metadata like app version, language, OS, and timezone (if enabled in preferences), sends a request to the Mr. DLib API, and processes the XML response into a list of BibEntry recommendations. If the title is missing or the request fails, it returns an empty list or an error message. The class also provides methods to retrieve recommendation headings and descriptions.
