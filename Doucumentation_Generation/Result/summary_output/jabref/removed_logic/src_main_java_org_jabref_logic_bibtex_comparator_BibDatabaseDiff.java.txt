The `BibDatabaseDiff` class compares two BibTeX databases (original and new) to identify differences in metadata, preamble, strings, and entries. It first checks for exact matches between entries, then near matches using a similarity threshold (0.4). Differences are categorized and stored, including added, removed, or modified entries. The comparison considers citation keys, titles, authors, and years for matching. The results can be retrieved via getter methods. This is useful for detecting duplicates or changes between database versions.
