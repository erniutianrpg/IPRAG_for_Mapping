This code defines a paged search interface `PagedSearchBasedParserFetcher` that extends `SearchBasedParserFetcher` and `PagedSearchBasedFetcher`. It provides methods to perform paginated searches for bibliographic entries (`BibEntry`), construct URLs for queries, fetch entries from URLs, and handle errors. The main method `performSearchPaged` executes a search, retrieves entries for a specific page, and returns them in a `Page` object. It handles URL construction, network requests, parsing, and post-processing cleanup of entries.
