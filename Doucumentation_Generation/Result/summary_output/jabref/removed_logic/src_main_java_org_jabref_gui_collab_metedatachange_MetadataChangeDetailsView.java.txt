This JavaFX class `MetadataChangeDetailsView` displays a summary of metadata changes in a JabRef database. It shows a list of modified metadata fields (like library protection, groups tree, encoding, etc.) in a vertical layout, with each change localized for user-friendly display. The view is anchored with padding and presents changes detected by `MetaDataDiff`.
