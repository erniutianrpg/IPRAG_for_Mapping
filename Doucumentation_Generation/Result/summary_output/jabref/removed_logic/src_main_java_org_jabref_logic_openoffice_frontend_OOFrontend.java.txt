The `OOFrontend` class manages citation groups in an OpenOffice document, providing functionality to create, remove, sort, and check overlaps of citations. It interacts with OpenOffice's API to handle reference marks, footnotes, and bibliography entries, ensuring proper citation management. Key features include visual sorting of citations, overlap detection, and synchronization with the document's text ranges. The class acts as a bridge between JabRef's citation logic and OpenOffice's document model.
