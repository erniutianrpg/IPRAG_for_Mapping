The `DBMSConnectionProperties` class manages database connection properties for a DBMS, including type, host, port, database name, credentials, SSL settings, and timezone. It initializes these properties from preferences, decrypts passwords, and provides methods to access them. The class also generates connection URLs and property objects for JDBC, validates properties, and implements equality checks (excluding password comparison). Essentially, it encapsulates all data needed to establish and configure a database connection.
