The `MrDLibImporter` class imports recommended articles from Mr. DLib's JSON API for display in a "Related Articles" tab. It parses JSON responses containing article recommendations, converts them into ranked `BibEntry` objects, and stores them in a `BibDatabase`. The importer checks for valid JSON format, extracts metadata (authors, title, year, etc.), sorts entries by rank, and provides access to recommendation headings, descriptions, and IDs. It extends `Importer` and supports JSON file type.
