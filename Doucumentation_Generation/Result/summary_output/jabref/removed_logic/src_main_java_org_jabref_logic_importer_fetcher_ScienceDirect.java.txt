This code implements a `FulltextFetcher` for ScienceDirect that retrieves PDF URLs of academic papers. Given a BibEntry with a DOI, it first checks the ScienceDirect API for a link. If found, it scrapes the webpage to extract the PDF URL either from metadata or embedded JSON. The fetcher uses an API key (either from preferences or a default) and handles various URL formats. It returns an Optional<URL> pointing to the PDF if successful, or empty if not. The trust level is set to PUBLISHER, indicating reliable sources.
