This code implements a full-text fetcher for the American Chemical Society (ACS) publications. Given a BibTeX entry, it checks for a DOI, constructs the ACS article URL, and attempts to find a PDF link on the page. If found, it returns the PDF URL by modifying the original URL from `/abs/` to `/pdf/`. The fetcher has a `PUBLISHER` trust level, indicating high reliability. It returns an empty result if no DOI exists or no PDF link is found.
