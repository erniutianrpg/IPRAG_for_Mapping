This code formats a comma-separated list of keywords into RIS (Research Information Systems) format. It takes an input string, splits it into individual keywords by commas, then outputs each keyword prefixed with "KW  - " and separated by newlines. For example, "word1,word2" becomes "KW  - word1\nKW  - word2". The code handles null input by returning an empty string and ensures no trailing newline after the last keyword.
