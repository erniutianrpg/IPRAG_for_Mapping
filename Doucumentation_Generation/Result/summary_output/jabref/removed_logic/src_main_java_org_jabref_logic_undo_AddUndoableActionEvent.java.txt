The `AddUndoableActionEvent` class represents an event triggered when a new undoable action is added to an undo manager. It extends `UndoChangeEvent` and provides information about the action's undo/redo capabilities and descriptions. The constructor accepts four parameters: `canUndo`, `undoDescription`, `canRedo`, and `redoDescription`, which are passed to the parent class to initialize the event state. (58 words)
