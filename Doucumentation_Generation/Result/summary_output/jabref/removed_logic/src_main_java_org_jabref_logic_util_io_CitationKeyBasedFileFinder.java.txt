The `CitationKeyBasedFileFinder` class locates files associated with a BibTeX entry by matching filenames to the entry's citation key. It searches specified directories for files with given extensions, then checks for exact or partial matches (if enabled) between filenames (without extensions) and the citation key. Partial matches must start with the key and not be followed by specific appendix characters. The results are returned as a sorted list of file paths.
