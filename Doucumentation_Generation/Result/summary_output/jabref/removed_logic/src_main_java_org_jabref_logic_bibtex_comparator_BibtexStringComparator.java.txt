The `BibtexStringComparator` class compares two `BibtexString` objects alphabetically by their names (case-insensitive). If `considerRefs` is true, it also checks if one string references the other (using `#name#` syntax) and adjusts the sorting order accordingly to ensure referenced strings appear after their dependencies. The comparison result follows the standard `Comparator` contract, returning a negative, zero, or positive integer based on the ordering.
