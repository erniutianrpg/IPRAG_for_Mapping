The `StudyDatabaseItem` class is a JavaFX-based view model for a study database, representing its name and enabled status as observable properties. It provides getters, setters, and property accessors for these fields, along with standard `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` implementations. This class serves as a UI-friendly wrapper for the `StudyDatabase` model, enabling data binding in JavaFX applications. (98 words)
