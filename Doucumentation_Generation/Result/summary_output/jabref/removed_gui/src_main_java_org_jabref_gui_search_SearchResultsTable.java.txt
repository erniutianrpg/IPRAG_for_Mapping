The `SearchResultsTable` class extends JavaFX's `TableView` to display search results in JabRef. It configures table columns based on preferences, including sorting and resizing behaviors. It adds a `LibraryColumn` if missing, binds the table's sorting to the model, applies CSS styling, and persists visual state. The table shows filtered and sorted entries from the provided model and listens to database changes.
