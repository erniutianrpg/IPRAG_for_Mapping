The `NamedCompound` class extends Java's `CompoundEdit` to group multiple undoable edits under a named action. It tracks whether edits exist (`hasEdits`) and provides customized presentation names for undo/redo operations in HTML format, listing all individual edit names. The class is part of JabRef's undo functionality, supporting localized strings for undo/redo labels.
