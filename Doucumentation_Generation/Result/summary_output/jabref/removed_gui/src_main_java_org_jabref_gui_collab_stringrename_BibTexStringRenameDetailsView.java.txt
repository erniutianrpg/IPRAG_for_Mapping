This JavaFX class `BibTexStringRenameDetailsView` displays a label showing the renaming details of a BibTeX string. It takes a `BibTexStringRename` object, creates a label with the new string name and old string content, anchors it to all sides of the view (8px padding), and adds it as the sole child. The class extends `DatabaseChangeDetailsView` for consistent change visualization in JabRef's UI. (Words: 58)
