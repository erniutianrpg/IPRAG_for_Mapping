This code creates a tabbed pane with two tabs for displaying BibTeX entries: a preview tab showing a formatted entry and a source tab displaying the raw BibTeX source. The `PreviewWithSourceTab` class generates these tabs using a `PreviewViewer` for the preview and a `CodeArea` for the source text. The source text is generated by converting the `BibEntry` object to BibTeX format using `BibEntryWriter`. The tabs are labeled appropriately, supporting localization and custom labels.
