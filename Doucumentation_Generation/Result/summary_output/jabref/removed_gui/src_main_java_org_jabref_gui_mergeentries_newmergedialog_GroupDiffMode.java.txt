The `GroupDiffMode` class implements the `DiffMethod` interface to specify a grouping-based difference comparison method. It stores a separator string used to split or group content during comparison. The class provides a constructor to set the separator and overrides the `separator()` method to return it. In essence, it enables customized grouping of content for diff operations using the specified separator. (56 words)
