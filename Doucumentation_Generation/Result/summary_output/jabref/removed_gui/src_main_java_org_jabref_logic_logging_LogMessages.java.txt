The `LogMessages` class is a singleton that maintains an observable list of log entries (`LogEntry`) for JabRef. It provides methods to add new log entries, clear all entries, and access an unmodifiable view of the logs. The observable list allows listeners to track changes. This serves as a central log storage and archival system for JabRef's message output. (94 words)
