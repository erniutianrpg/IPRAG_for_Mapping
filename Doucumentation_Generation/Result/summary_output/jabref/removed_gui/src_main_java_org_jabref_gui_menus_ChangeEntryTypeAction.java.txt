The `ChangeEntryTypeAction` class is a command that changes the entry type of selected `BibEntry` items to a specified `EntryType`. It groups these changes into an undoable operation using `NamedCompound` and updates the `UndoManager`. The class also provides a status message describing the entry type change. The action is executed via the `execute()` method, which applies the type change to all entries and records it for undo functionality.
