This class `ContainsAndRegexBasedSearchRuleDescriber` generates a user-friendly description of a search operation in JabRef. It indicates whether the search uses regular expressions or simple term matching, lists all search terms (highlighting the first term in bold), and specifies if the search is case-sensitive. The description is formatted as a `TextFlow` for display in the GUI, with localized text and appropriate styling for terms and operators like "and". The output combines all these elements into a coherent search description.
