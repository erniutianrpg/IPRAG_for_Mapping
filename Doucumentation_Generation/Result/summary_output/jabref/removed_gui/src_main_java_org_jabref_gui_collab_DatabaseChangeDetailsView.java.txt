This code defines an abstract JavaFX `AnchorPane` class `DatabaseChangeDetailsView` that serves as a base view for displaying different types of database changes in JabRef. It uses Java's `sealed` class feature to restrict inheritance to specific permitted subclasses, each representing a different type of change (entry modifications, group changes, metadata changes, etc.). This design ensures type safety while allowing various change types to be displayed consistently.
