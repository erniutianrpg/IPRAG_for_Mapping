The `DocumentViewModel` abstract class provides a base model for document viewers in JavaFX. It tracks the maximum number of pages (`maxPages`) via a JavaFX property and offers methods to access this value. It also declares an abstract method `getPages()` to retrieve document pages as an observable list of `DocumentPageViewModel` objects, which subclasses must implement. This class serves as a foundation for document viewing functionality with page management. (94 words)
