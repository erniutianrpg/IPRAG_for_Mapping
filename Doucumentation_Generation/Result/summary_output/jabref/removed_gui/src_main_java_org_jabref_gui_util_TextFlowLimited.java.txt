The `TextFlowLimited` class extends JavaFX's `TextFlow` to create a collapsible text container. Initially, it shows a limited height (38px) with a "(more)" hyperlink. When clicked, it smoothly animates to full height over 200ms. In collapsed state, it clips overflow text and positions the hyperlink at the bottom-right. The expanded state removes the hyperlink and clipping. This provides a space-saving way to display long text with optional expansion.
