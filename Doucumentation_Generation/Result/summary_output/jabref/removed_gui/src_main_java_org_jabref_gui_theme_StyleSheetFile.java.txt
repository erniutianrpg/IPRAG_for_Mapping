The `StyleSheetFile` class manages CSS stylesheets for a Java application, handling both file-based and data-embedded URLs. It loads CSS files, converts small files (<48KB) into Base64-encoded data URLs for in-memory storage (improving reliability if the source file is deleted), and falls back to file URLs for larger stylesheets. It provides methods to access stylesheets for both JavaFX scenes and web engines, with automatic reloading and existence checks. The class also logs warnings for missing or invalid CSS files.
