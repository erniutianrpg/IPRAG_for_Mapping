The `HelpAction` class extends `SimpleCommand` to open a specific help page from JabRef's documentation in a browser. When executed, it constructs a URL using `HelpFile` (e.g., `https://docs.jabref.org/[pageName]`) and opens it via `JabRefDesktop`. The `DialogService` handles potential errors. In short, it launches a browser with the requested help page. (98 words)
