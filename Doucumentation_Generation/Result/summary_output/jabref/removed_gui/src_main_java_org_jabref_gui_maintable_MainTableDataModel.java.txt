The `MainTableDataModel` class manages and filters BibTeX entries for display in a main table. It binds to group and search queries from the `StateManager` to filter entries based on active groups and search terms. The class maintains sorted and filtered lists of entries, formats field values, and updates search result counts. It supports different group view modes (intersection/union) and refreshes the display when preferences change. The filtered entries are wrapped in a `SortedList` for table display.
