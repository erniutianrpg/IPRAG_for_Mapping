The `PushToApplications` class manages a list of external applications (like Emacs, LyX, TeXmaker, etc.) that can receive pushed content from JabRef. It provides static methods to retrieve all supported applications (`getAllApplications`) or a specific application by name (`getApplicationByName`). The class initializes and stores application instances only once, using dependency injection (`DialogService` and `PreferencesService`) for their construction. This serves as a central registry for push-to-application functionality in JabRef.
