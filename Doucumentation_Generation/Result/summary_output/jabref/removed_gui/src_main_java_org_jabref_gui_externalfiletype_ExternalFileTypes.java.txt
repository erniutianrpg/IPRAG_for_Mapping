This code manages external file types for JabRef, a reference management software. It provides functionality to:

1. Get default file types (PDF, HTML, etc.)
2. Look up file types by name, extension, filename, or MIME type
3. Handle unknown file types
4. Convert between file type representations and preference storage formats
5. Manage customizations of default file types (additions, modifications, removals)

The class acts as a utility for file type operations, supporting both default types and user-customized types stored in preferences. It includes fallback handling for HTML files and special handling for removed default types.
