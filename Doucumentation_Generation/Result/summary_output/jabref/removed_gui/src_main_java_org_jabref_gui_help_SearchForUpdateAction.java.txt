The `SearchForUpdateAction` class is a command that checks for software updates asynchronously. It uses `VersionWorker` to compare the current version (from `BuildInfo`) with the latest available version, then notifies the user via `DialogService`. The update check runs in the background using `TaskExecutor`, and preferences are managed via `InternalPreferences`. Essentially, it triggers an automated version check and update notification process.
