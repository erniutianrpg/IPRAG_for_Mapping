The `UrlEditorViewModel` class manages URL field functionality in a JavaFX application. It validates whether the input text is a blank or invalid URL (binding to `validUrlIsNotPresent` property) and provides methods to check this status. It also includes a method `openExternalLink()` to open the URL in a browser, handling errors if the link can't be opened. The class extends `AbstractEditorViewModel` and uses dependency injection for services like dialog handling and field validation.
