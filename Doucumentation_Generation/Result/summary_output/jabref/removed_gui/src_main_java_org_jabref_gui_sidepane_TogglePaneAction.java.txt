The `TogglePaneAction` class toggles the visibility of a side pane in a GUI application. When executed, it checks if the specified pane (`SidePaneType`) is currently visible. If not, it adds the pane to the visible components and sorts them based on preferences. If already visible, it removes the pane. The class uses `StateManager` to track visible panes and `SidePanePreferences` for sorting order.
