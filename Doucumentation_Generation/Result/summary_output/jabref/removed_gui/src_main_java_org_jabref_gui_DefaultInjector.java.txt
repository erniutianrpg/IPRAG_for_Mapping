The `DefaultInjector` class is a dependency injection factory for a JabRef GUI application. It implements `PresenterFactory` to create and inject dependencies for presenters. The `createDependency` method handles specific dependency instances (like `DialogService`, `PreferencesService`, etc.) by retrieving them from global singletons (`Globals`), while other classes are instantiated via reflection. The `instantiatePresenter` and `injectMembers` methods use this logic to set up dependencies before delegating to the underlying injection framework (AfterBurner). This centralizes dependency management for the application. (98 words)
