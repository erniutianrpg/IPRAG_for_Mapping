This JavaFX panel allows users to manage field formatter cleanups in JabRef. It provides a table to view/edit existing cleanups (field-formatter pairs), combo boxes to add new ones, and buttons to reset/clear all. The UI includes:
- Checkbox to enable/disable cleanups
- Table showing current cleanups with delete functionality
- Dropdowns to select fields and formatters
- Buttons for adding, clearing, or resetting to recommended cleanups
The panel binds to a ViewModel that manages the underlying data and operations.
