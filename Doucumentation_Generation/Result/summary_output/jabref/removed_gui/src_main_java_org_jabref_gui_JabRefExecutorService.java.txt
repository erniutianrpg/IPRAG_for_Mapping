The `JabRefExecutorService` class manages all non-GUI threads in JabRef. It provides two thread pools (normal and low priority) for executing tasks, with methods for synchronous/asynchronous execution, task collections, and interruptible tasks. It also handles a dedicated remote thread and scheduled timer tasks. The class includes graceful shutdown procedures for all threads, ensuring proper termination. Exception handling and thread naming are implemented throughout.
