This JavaFX code defines an `AdvancedCiteDialogView` class for a dialog in JabRef that handles advanced citation options. The dialog includes radio buttons (`inPar` and `inText`) for citation style selection and a text field (`pageInfo`) for page information. The view binds these UI elements bidirectionally to a view model (`AdvancedCiteDialogViewModel`) which manages the data. The dialog returns the view model when "OK" is clicked. The title is localized as "Cite special". The class uses the Afterburner framework for FX view loading.
