The `OOError` class extends `JabRefException` to handle and display OpenOffice/LibreOffice-related errors in JabRef. It provides constructors for custom error messages and titles, methods to show error dialogs, and static factory methods to convert various exceptions (like `DisposedException`, `NoDocumentException`) into standardized `OOError` instances. It also includes predefined error messages for common scenarios like no open database, no valid citation style, or no selected entries for citation. The class centralizes error handling for OpenOffice/LibreOffice integration in JabRef. (98 words)
