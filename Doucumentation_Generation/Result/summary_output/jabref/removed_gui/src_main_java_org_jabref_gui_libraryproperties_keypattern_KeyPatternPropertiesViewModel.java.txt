This JavaFX ViewModel class manages citation key patterns for a bibliography database in JabRef. It initializes and maintains two properties: a list of entry-specific key patterns (`patternListProperty`) and a default pattern (`defaultKeyPatternProperty`). The `storeSettings()` method collects these patterns, validates them, and saves them to the database's metadata. The class implements `PropertiesTabViewModel` but leaves `setValues()` empty, indicating patterns are likely set elsewhere. It serves as a bridge between the UI and the database's citation key pattern storage.
