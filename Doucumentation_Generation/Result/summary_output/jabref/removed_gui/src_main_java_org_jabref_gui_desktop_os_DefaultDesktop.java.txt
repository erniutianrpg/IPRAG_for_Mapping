The `DefaultDesktop` class implements `NativeDesktop` to provide cross-platform desktop operations like opening files/folders, detecting program paths, and getting directories. It uses Java's `Desktop` class for basic file operations (open file, open with application, open folder) and defaults to user home for file chooser directory. Unsupported features (like opening console) log errors. It serves as a fallback implementation when OS-specific features aren't available.
