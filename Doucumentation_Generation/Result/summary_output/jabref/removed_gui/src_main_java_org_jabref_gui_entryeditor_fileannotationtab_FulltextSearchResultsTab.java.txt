The `FulltextSearchResultsTab` class is a JavaFX component for displaying full-text search results in PDF files linked to a BibEntry. It shows search matches organized by file and page, with clickable links to open files or jump to specific pages. The tab appears only when a full-text search is active and results are found. It includes context menus for file operations and integrates with JabRef's document viewer for page navigation. The UI presents results with formatted text, tooltips, and separators for readability.
