This JavaFX code defines a GUI tab (`ContentSelectorView`) for managing content selectors in JabRef, a reference management software. The tab allows users to:
1. Add/remove fields (like author, title) via `fieldsListView`
2. Add/remove keywords for selected fields via `keywordsListView`
3. Uses view-model binding to synchronize UI with data
4. Shows confirmation dialogs for removal actions
5. Disables buttons when no selection is made

The class extends `AbstractPropertiesTabView` and handles user interactions for managing bibliographic content selectors in a database context.
