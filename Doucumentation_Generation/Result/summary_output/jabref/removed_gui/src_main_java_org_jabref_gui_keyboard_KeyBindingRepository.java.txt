The `KeyBindingRepository` class manages keyboard shortcuts (key bindings) for an application. It stores key bindings in a sorted map, allows getting/setting/resetting bindings to defaults, and checks if key events match specific bindings. It supports OS-specific bindings (e.g., converting "ctrl" to "meta" on macOS) and provides methods to retrieve all bindings. The class also includes equality checks and utility methods for key event handling.
