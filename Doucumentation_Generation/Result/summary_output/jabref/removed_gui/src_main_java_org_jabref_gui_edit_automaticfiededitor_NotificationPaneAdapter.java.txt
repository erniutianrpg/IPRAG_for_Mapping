The `NotificationPaneAdapter` class extends `LibraryTab.DatabaseNotification` to display a temporary notification in JabRef's GUI. It shows a message indicating how many entries were affected out of the total entries (e.g., "5/10 affected entries") with an info icon. The notification automatically disappears after 2 seconds. This is used to provide feedback during automatic field editing operations.
