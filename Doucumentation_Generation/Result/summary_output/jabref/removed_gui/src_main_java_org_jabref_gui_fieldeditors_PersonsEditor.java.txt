The `PersonsEditor` class is a JavaFX-based field editor for handling person names in BibTeX entries. It provides a text input control (single or multi-line) with auto-completion, context menus, and validation. The editor binds to a `BibEntry`, manages text input through a view model, and supports suggestions via a `SuggestionProvider`. It also includes validation checks and UI thread-safe property binding.
