The `SaveAction` class is a GUI command wrapper for saving operations in JabRef. It supports three save methods: `SAVE`, `SAVE_AS`, and `SAVE_SELECTED`. Depending on the method chosen, it either saves the current database, saves with a new name/location, or saves only selected entries. The action's executability is bound to whether entries are selected or a database is open. When executed, it delegates the operation to `SaveDatabaseAction` with the appropriate method. This class serves as a temporary solution pending refactoring of the save functionality. (98 words)
