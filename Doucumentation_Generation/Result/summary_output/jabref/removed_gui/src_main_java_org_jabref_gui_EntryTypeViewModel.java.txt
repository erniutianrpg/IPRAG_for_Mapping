The `EntryTypeViewModel` class manages the logic for fetching bibliographic entries by ID using various fetchers (like DOI) in JabRef. It handles user input validation, fetcher selection, and search execution. The class displays appropriate error/success messages and allows manual entry addition if fetching fails. It maintains search state, stores user preferences, and integrates with JabRef's import system to add fetched entries to the library after duplicate checks. The code uses JavaFX properties for UI binding and asynchronous task execution for fetching operations.
