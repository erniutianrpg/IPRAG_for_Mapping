This code automatically links associated files to BibTeX entries in JabRef. It searches for files in specified directories that match an entry's criteria, checks if they're already linked, and adds new file links if not found. The `LinkFilesResult` tracks changed entries and file exceptions. Key features include file type handling, relative path conversion, and undo support for added files. The main method `linkAssociatedFiles` processes entries while `findAssociatedNotLinkedFiles` performs the actual file search and linking.
