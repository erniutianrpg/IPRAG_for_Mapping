The `PreambleChange` class handles changes to the preamble (a BibTeX file's introductory content) in JabRef. It tracks differences between old and new preambles using `PreambleDiff`, provides a human-readable change description, and applies the preamble update to the database. The change is undoable via `UndoablePreambleChange`, which stores both the original and new preamble states. This class is part of JabRef's collaborative editing and change tracking system. (98 words)
