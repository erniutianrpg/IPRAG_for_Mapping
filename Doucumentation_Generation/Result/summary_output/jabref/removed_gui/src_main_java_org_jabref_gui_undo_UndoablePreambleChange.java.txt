The `UndoablePreambleChange` class represents an undoable/redoable change to a BibTeX database's preamble. It stores the old and new preamble values and the associated database. The `undo()` method reverts the preamble to the old value, while `redo()` reapplies the new value. The class extends `AbstractUndoableJabRefEdit` to provide this undo/redo functionality and labels the action as "change preamble" for presentation. (94 words)
