This code defines an abstract `PageDimension` class that calculates width and height of a page while maintaining aspect ratio. It provides factory methods to create instances with either fixed width or height. The two private subclasses (`FixedWidthPageDimension` and `FixedHeightPageDimension`) implement the calculations: fixed width adjusts height based on aspect ratio, while fixed height adjusts width. The main functionality is to dynamically compute one dimension while keeping the other fixed.
