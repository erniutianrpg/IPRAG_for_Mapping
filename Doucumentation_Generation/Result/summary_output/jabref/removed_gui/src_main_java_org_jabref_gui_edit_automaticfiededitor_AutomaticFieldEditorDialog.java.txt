The `AutomaticFieldEditorDialog` is a JavaFX dialog for editing fields of selected BibTeX entries automatically. It initializes with tabs for different field editing operations, manages undo/redo functionality, and tracks changes. When confirmed, it saves changes; when canceled, it attempts to undo them. The dialog uses a view model (`AutomaticFieldEditorViewModel`) to handle operations and updates a notification pane to show affected entries. It integrates with JabRef's global state and undo manager.
