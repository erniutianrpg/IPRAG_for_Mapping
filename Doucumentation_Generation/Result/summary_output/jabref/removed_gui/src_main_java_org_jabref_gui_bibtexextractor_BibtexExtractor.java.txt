The `BibtexExtractor` class extracts bibliographic metadata (authors, URLs, year, pages, title, journal/publisher) from a text input and creates a BibEntry object. It uses regex patterns to identify and extract these components, then organizes them into either an Article or Book entry type. The extraction process involves sequentially removing found elements (URLs, authors, year, pages) from the input string and processing the remaining text for title and publisher information. The final BibEntry contains all extracted fields and the remaining unparsed text as a comment.
