This code defines a `GroupChangeDetailsView` class that displays details about group changes in a JabRef database. It shows either a simple notification when groups are removed (null case) or a message indicating that accepting the change will replace the entire groups tree with an externally modified version. The message is localized and displayed in a JavaFX Label with 8-pixel padding on all sides. The view inherits from `DatabaseChangeDetailsView` and is part of JabRef's change tracking system.
