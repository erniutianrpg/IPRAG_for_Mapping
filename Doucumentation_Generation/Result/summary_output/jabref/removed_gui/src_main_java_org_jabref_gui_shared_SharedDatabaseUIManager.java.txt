The `SharedDatabaseUIManager` class manages interactions with shared databases in JabRef. It handles connection loss events (offering reconnect, offline work, or close options), update conflicts (with merge functionality), and deleted shared entries. It also provides methods to open new shared database tabs and initialize shared databases from parser results, synchronizing local and remote changes. The class uses event listeners to respond to database-related events and maintains synchronization between local and shared databases.
