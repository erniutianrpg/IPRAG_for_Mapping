This code defines a `ViewModelTreeTableCellFactory` class that creates customizable `TreeTableCell` instances for JavaFX TreeTableView. It provides fluent methods to configure cell text, graphics (including icons), tooltips, and mouse-click handlers. The factory uses callbacks to dynamically generate cell content based on the row's view model. When installed on a column, it binds cell values to the view model's properties and applies the specified visual and interactive configurations. The `updateItem` method handles rendering logic, clearing or populating cells based on the provided view model data.
