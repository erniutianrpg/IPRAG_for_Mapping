This code defines an enum `SearchDisplayMode` that represents two search display modes: `FLOAT` (gray out non-matches) and `FILTER` (hide non-matches). Each mode has a display name and tooltip text, localized using `Supplier<String>` to support dynamic language changes. The enum provides methods `getDisplayName()` and `getToolTipText()` to access these values. The design ensures localization updates are reflected without restarting the application.
