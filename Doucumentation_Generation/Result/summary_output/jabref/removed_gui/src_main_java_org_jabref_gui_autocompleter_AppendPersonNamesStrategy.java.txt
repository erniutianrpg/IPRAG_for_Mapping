The `AppendPersonNamesStrategy` class extends `AppendWordsStrategy` to handle autocompletion for person names. It provides flexibility in splitting names either by a space (for last names) or by " and " (default for full names) based on the `separationBySpace` boolean parameter. The delimiter used for splitting is determined by the `getDelimiter()` method.
