The `FieldViewModel` class represents a view model for managing field properties in a bibliographic entry. It encapsulates a `Field` object and provides JavaFX properties for field name, required status, multiline capability, and priority. The class includes methods to access these properties, convert to a `BibField`, and automatically updates the field's multiline property. The nested `Mandatory` enum defines field requirement options (Required/Optional) with localized display names. Essentially, it bridges field data with UI components while maintaining property synchronization. (98 words)
