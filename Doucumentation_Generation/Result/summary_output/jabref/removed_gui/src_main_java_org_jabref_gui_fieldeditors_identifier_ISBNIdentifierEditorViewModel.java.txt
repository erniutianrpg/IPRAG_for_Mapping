This code defines a view model for an ISBN identifier editor in JabRef, a reference management software. It extends `BaseIdentifierEditorViewModel` to handle ISBN fields, enabling validation and auto-completion. The `fetchBibliographyInformation` method fetches and merges bibliographic data for a given entry using ISBN. The editor is configured to allow auto-completion but not to suggest values immediately. It utilizes JabRef's services for dialogs, task execution, and preferences.
