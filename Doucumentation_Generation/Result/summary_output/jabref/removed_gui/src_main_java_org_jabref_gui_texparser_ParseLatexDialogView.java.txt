This JavaFX dialog allows users to search for citations in LaTeX files. It provides a UI to:
1. Browse and select a LaTeX directory
2. Search for files in the directory
3. Display found files in a checkable tree view
4. Select/deselect files for parsing
5. Parse selected files to extract citations

The dialog binds UI elements to a ViewModel that handles validation, file operations, and parsing logic. It disables buttons during operations and shows progress indicators. The parsed citations can then be processed by the calling application.
