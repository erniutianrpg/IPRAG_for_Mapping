The `ExporterViewModel` class wraps a `TemplateExporter` from JabRef's logic module to provide a view model for exporter customization. It exposes three properties (name, layout file name, and file extension) as JavaFX `StringProperty` objects, which are initialized from the wrapped `TemplateExporter`. The class serves as an adapter between the logic layer (`TemplateExporter`) and the GUI layer, enabling data binding for exporter settings in the UI. The main functionality includes property accessors and maintaining the underlying exporter instance.
