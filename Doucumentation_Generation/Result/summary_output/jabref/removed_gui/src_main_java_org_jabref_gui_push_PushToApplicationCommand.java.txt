The `PushToApplicationCommand` class handles pushing selected BibTeX entries to an external application (like Emacs). It checks if entries have citation keys (if required), configures UI controls (buttons/menu items) for the target application, and executes the push operation in a background thread. The target application is determined by user preferences, with Emacs as the default. The command is only executable when entries are selected in a database.
