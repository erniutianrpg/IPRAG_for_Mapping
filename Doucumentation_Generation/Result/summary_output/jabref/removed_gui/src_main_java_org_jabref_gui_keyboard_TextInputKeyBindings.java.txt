This code handles keyboard shortcuts for text input controls in a JavaFX application. It checks if the focused element is a text field, then maps key events to specific actions (like deleting characters, moving the cursor, changing text case, or clearing text). Each action modifies the text or cursor position accordingly and consumes the event to prevent default handling. The bindings are retrieved from a global key binding repository.
