The `PreviewPanel` class in JabRef provides a GUI panel for previewing BibTeX entries with various functionalities. It supports drag-and-drop operations for file attachments, keyboard shortcuts for copying/printing previews, and cycling through different preview layouts. The panel includes a context menu for quick actions and handles file linking (copy/move/link) when files are dropped onto it. It also manages preview style changes and integrates with JabRef's theme and state management systems.
