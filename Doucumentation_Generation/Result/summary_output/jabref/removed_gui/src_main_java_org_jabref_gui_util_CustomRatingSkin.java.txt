This code extends JavaFX's `RatingSkin` class to customize a rating control's appearance and behavior. It replaces the default rating icons with JabRef's custom ranking icons (`IconTheme.JabRefIcons.RANKING`) and disables mouse event consumption, allowing interactions to pass through. The customization is minimal, focusing only on the visual representation of the rating buttons.
