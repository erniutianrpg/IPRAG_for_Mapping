The `PushToApplication` interface defines methods for pushing selected BibTeX entries to an external application from JabRef. It includes functionality to get display information (name, tooltip, icon), push entries to the application (with database context and optional citation keys), handle post-operation tasks, check if citation keys are required, and manage settings. The interface supports both the core pushing operation (off the GUI thread) and subsequent GUI updates.
