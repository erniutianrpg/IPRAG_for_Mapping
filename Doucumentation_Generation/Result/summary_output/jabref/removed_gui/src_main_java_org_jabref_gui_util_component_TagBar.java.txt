The `TagBar` class is a JavaFX component that displays a collection of tags as an interactive horizontal bar. It allows adding new tags via text input, removing tags by clicking, and supports custom string conversion for tag display. The component listens to changes in the tag list and updates the UI accordingly. It also supports different field properties (like single/multiple entry links) to control input behavior. Tags can be clicked with custom event handling. The UI is defined in FXML and styled with CSS.
