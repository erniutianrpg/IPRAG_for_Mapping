This code implements an auto-completion binding for JavaFX text input controls. It connects a text input field with a suggestion provider, showing popup suggestions as the user types. The class handles text changes, focus events, and completion selection, using strategies to analyze input and determine suggestions. It supports custom string converters and different auto-completion strategies. The binding can be configured to show suggestions on focus and properly cleans up listeners when disposed.
