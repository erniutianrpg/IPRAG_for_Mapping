This code implements undo/redo functionality for inserting a string (`BibtexString`) into a BibTeX database (`BibDatabase`). The `undo()` method removes the string, while `redo()` re-adds it, handling potential key collisions. The class extends `AbstractUndoableJabRefEdit` and provides a localized presentation name for the action. It's part of JabRef's undo system for bibliography management.
