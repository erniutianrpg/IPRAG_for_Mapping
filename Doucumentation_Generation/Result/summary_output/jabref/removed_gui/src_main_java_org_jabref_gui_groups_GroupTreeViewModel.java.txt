The `GroupTreeViewModel` class manages the group hierarchy in JabRef's UI, handling operations like creating, editing, sorting, and removing groups. It maintains the group tree structure, synchronizes with the database metadata, and provides methods for group manipulation (add/remove entries, drag-and-drop, filtering). The class also handles user interactions through dialogs and updates the state manager accordingly. It supports various group types (keyword, explicit, search, etc.) with specific rules for each type's behavior and editability.
