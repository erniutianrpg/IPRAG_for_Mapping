The `SortCriterionViewModel` class represents a sort criterion in a JavaFX UI, wrapping a field and sort direction (ascending/descending). It provides observable properties for a `Field` and a boolean `descending` flag, initialized from a `SaveOrder.SortCriterion`. The class allows getting/setting these properties and converting back to a `SortCriterion` object. Essentially, it bridges between UI controls and the model's sort criteria. (98 words)
