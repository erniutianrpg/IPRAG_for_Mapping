The `ActionHelper` class provides utility methods to create boolean expressions (bindings) for various UI conditions in JabRef. These methods check: if a database is active, if it's shared/study, if entries are selected, if fields are set in entries, if files are linked/present for entries, and if multiple databases are open. The conditions are used to enable/disable UI actions dynamically based on the application state managed by `StateManager` and `PreferencesService`.
