The `PersonsEditorViewModel` class is a ViewModel for editing person-type fields (like authors) in JabRef. It provides auto-completion functionality for author names, using a `PersonNameStringConverter` for display and an `AppendPersonNamesStrategy` for handling suggestions. The class extends `AbstractEditorViewModel` and leverages JabRef's auto-completer system to suggest and validate author entries based on user preferences and field checkers.
