The `CleanupSingleAction` class performs cleanup operations on a single BibTeX entry in JabRef. It shows a dialog for user preferences, confirms PDF renaming if needed, then executes cleanup tasks (like field formatting) based on selected preferences. Changes are tracked for undo functionality. The class integrates with JabRef's preferences, dialog system, and undo manager while ensuring user confirmation for irreversible operations.
