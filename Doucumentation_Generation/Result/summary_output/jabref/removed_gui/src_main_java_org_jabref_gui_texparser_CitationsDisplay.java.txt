The `CitationsDisplay` class is a JavaFX `ListView` that displays LaTeX citation references with contextual information. It shows each citation's context text, source file path (relative to a base path), and line/column positions. The list items include icons and formatted text, with tooltips that highlight the citation within its source line. The component binds its width to adjust text wrapping dynamically and provides visual styling for better readability.
