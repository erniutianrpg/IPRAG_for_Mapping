The `CustomTitledPaneSkin` class extends JavaFX's `TitledPaneSkin` to provide a customizable titled pane where the arrow icon can be positioned either on the left (default) or right. It uses CSS styling and property bindings to dynamically adjust the layout of the title, arrow button, and graphic elements when the arrow side changes. The class also handles proper cleanup of bindings and listeners when disposed.
