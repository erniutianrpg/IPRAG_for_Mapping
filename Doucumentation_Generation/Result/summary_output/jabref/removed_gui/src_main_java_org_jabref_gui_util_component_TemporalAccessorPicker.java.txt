The `TemporalAccessorPicker` class extends JavaFX's `DatePicker` to support both date and time selection with a configurable format. It synchronizes a `LocalDate` value with a `TemporalAccessor` (enriched with time) using bidirectional binding. The class handles date parsing/formatting with a default pattern ("yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm") and supports incomplete dates. It also includes a context menu for text editing. The picker converts between `LocalDate` (for the UI) and `TemporalAccessor` (for the model), ensuring seamless integration of date and time components.
