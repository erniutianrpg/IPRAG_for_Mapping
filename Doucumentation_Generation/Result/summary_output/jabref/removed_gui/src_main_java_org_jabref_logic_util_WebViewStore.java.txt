The `WebViewStore` class manages a pool of JavaFX `WebView` instances to prevent UI freezes during their creation. It preloads a configurable number of `WebView` instances at startup (default: 4) and maintains a minimum threshold (default: 2). When a `WebView` is requested via `get()`, it returns a preloaded instance if available, otherwise creates a new one. New instances are added asynchronously via `Platform.runLater()` to avoid UI blocking. The store ensures efficient `WebView` reuse and thread-safe initialization.
