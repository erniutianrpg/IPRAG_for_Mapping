This code defines an abstract `DiffHighlighter` class for highlighting differences between text in two `StyleClassedTextArea` components. It supports different diff methods (words, chars, commas) to split and compare text. The class provides methods to highlight differences, split strings based on the selected method, and manage diff configurations. It's designed to be extended by specific implementations (`SplitDiffHighlighter`, `UnifiedDiffHighlighter`) for different highlighting styles. The class also includes enums for diff methods and change types, and a record to track changes.
