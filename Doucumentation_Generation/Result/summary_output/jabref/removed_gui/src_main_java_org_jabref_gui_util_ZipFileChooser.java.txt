The `ZipFileChooser` class is a JavaFX dialog that allows users to select a file from a ZIP archive. It displays a table with file details (name, last modified date, and size) for all `.class` files in the ZIP. Users can select a single file, and the dialog returns the selected file's path when OK is clicked, or `null` if canceled. The dialog is initialized with the ZIP file's contents and formatted for user interaction.
