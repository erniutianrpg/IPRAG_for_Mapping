The `KeywordMerger` class merges two keyword strings from BibTeX entries using a specified delimiter from preferences. It implements the `FieldMerger` interface, combining keywords from two sources (`keywordsA` and `keywordsB`) into a single list, separated by the configured delimiter. The merger ensures non-null preferences and uses `KeywordList.merge()` for the actual merging logic. The result is returned as a concatenated string.
