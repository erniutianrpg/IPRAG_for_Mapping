This JavaFX dialog helps resolve duplicate BibTeX entries in JabRef. It presents a three-way merge view to compare two entries and offers options to keep left/right/both entries, merge them, or auto-remove exact duplicates. The dialog remembers window state and provides help functionality. The result indicates which entry(s) to keep or whether to merge. It supports different duplicate resolution scenarios (search, import check, etc.) through the `DuplicateResolverType` parameter.
