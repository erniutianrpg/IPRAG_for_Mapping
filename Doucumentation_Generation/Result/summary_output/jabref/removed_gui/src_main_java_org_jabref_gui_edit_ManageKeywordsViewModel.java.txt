The `ManageKeywordsViewModel` class manages keywords for BibTeX entries in a JavaFX application. It provides functionality to:
1. Display keywords either contained in all entries or any entry
2. Add, remove, and save keywords
3. Track changes for undo operations
4. Update keywords across multiple entries while maintaining separation using a configurable separator

The class maintains observable lists for UI binding and handles keyword operations (add/remove) across selected BibTeX entries, with support for undoable changes.
