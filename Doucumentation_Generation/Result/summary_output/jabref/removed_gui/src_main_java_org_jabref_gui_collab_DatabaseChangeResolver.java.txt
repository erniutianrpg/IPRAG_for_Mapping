This code defines an abstract class `DatabaseChangeResolver` (with `EntryChangeResolver` as its only permitted subclass) that serves as a base for resolving database changes in JabRef. It requires a `DialogService` for user interaction and declares an abstract method `askUserToResolveChange()` that returns an optional `DatabaseChange`, forcing subclasses to implement user resolution logic for database changes. The class provides a foundation for handling change conflicts in a collaborative editing context.
