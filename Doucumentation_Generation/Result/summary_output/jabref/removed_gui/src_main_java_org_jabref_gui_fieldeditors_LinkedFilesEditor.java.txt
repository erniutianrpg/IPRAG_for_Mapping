The `LinkedFilesEditor` class is a JavaFX-based UI component for managing linked files in a BibTeX entry. It provides functionality to:
- Display a list of linked files with icons, descriptions, and progress indicators
- Support drag-and-drop reordering of files
- Add new files via dialog or URL
- Perform file operations (open, edit, download, rename, move, delete)
- Handle PDF metadata (read/write)
- Show context menus with relevant actions
- Support keyboard shortcuts for deletion
- Visualize automatically found files with option to accept them

The editor binds to a BibEntry and updates its linked files through a ViewModel pattern.
