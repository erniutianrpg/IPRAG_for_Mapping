The `FileAnnotationTab` class is a JavaFX tab component for the JabRef reference manager that displays file annotations for a selected bibliography entry. It extends `EntryEditorTab` and checks if an entry has a file field (`StandardField.FILE`) to determine visibility. When bound to an entry, it loads and displays a view (`FileAnnotationTabView`) showing file annotations from a cache (`FileAnnotationCache`). The tab includes localized text ("File annotations") and a tooltip.
