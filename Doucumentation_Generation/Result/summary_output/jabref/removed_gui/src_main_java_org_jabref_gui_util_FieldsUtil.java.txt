This code provides utility methods for handling bibliographic fields in JabRef. It includes a `StringConverter` for converting between `Field` objects and their display names, and a method `getNameWithType` that returns a field's display name appended with its type (Special, IEEE, Internal, Custom). The converter handles null values and string parsing, while `getNameWithType` categorizes fields and localizes their type descriptions.
