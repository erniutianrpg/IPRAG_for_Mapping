This code defines a custom annotation `@AllowedToUseAwt` in Java, specifically for marking logic classes that are permitted to access AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit). The annotation includes a mandatory `value()` field to provide a rationale explaining why AWT access is allowed for the annotated class. This serves as architectural documentation and potentially enforces coding standards.
