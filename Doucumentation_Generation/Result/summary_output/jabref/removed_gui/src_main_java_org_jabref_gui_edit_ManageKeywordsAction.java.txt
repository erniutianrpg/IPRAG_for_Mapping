The `ManageKeywordsAction` class is a command in JabRef that opens a keyword management dialog for selected entries in a database. It extends `SimpleCommand` and checks if a database is open and entries are selected before enabling execution. When executed, it displays a custom dialog (`ManageKeywordsDialog`) for managing keywords of the selected entries, using dependency injection for the `DialogService`. The action is disabled with a status message if no entries are selected.
