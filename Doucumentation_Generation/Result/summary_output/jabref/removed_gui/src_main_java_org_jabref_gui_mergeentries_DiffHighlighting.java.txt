This code provides functionality to highlight differences between two strings (`baseString` and `modifiedString`) by comparing them line-by-line (split by a `separator`). It uses a diff algorithm to detect changes (insertions, deletions, modifications) and generates styled `Text` objects (added, removed, changed, or unchanged) for visualization. The `generateDiffHighlighting` method shows asymmetric differences (removals/additions), while `generateSymmetricHighlighting` marks changes uniformly. The styling is applied via CSS classes (`text-added`, `text-removed`, etc.). The code is part of a merge entries utility, likely for a JavaFX application.
