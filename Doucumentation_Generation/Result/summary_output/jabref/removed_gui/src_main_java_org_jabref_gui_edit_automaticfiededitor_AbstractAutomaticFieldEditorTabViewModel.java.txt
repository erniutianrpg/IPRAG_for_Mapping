This code defines an abstract ViewModel class `AbstractAutomaticFieldEditorTabViewModel` for managing fields in a bibliography database. It maintains an observable list of all fields (combining standard fields and database-specific fields), ensures no duplicates, and sorts them alphabetically. The class provides access to these fields via `getAllFields()` and is designed to work with JabRef's GUI framework, extending `AbstractViewModel` and using `StateManager` for application state management.
