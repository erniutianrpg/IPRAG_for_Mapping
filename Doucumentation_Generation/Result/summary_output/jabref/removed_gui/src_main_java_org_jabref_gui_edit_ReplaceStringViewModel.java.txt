The `ReplaceStringViewModel` class provides functionality to find and replace text in BibTeX entries within a JabRef library. It supports replacing text in either selected entries or all entries, and in specific fields or all fields. The replacement operation is undoable. The class uses JavaFX properties for UI binding and tracks the number of replacements made. Key features include case-sensitive string replacement, undo support via `NamedCompound`, and configurable scope (selected/all entries, specific/all fields).
