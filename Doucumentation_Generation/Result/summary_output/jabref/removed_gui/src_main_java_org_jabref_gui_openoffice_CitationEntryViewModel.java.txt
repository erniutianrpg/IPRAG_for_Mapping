The `CitationEntryViewModel` class is a JavaFX-based view model that represents a citation entry for OpenOffice integration. It wraps a `CitationEntry` with observable properties (`citation` and `extraInformation`) for UI binding. It provides constructors to create instances from either raw data or a `CitationEntry` object, methods to convert back to `CitationEntry`, and property accessors for UI synchronization. The class manages citation reference mark names, citation text, and optional extra information (like page numbers).
