This JavaFX `DateEditor` class is a custom field editor for handling date inputs in a BibTeX entry. It uses a `TemporalAccessorPicker` for date selection, binds the UI to a `DateEditorViewModel` for data handling, and includes validation via `EditorValidator`. The editor supports bidirectional data binding between the UI and model, and integrates with JabRef's autocompletion and field validation systems. It's part of a larger bibliography management system (JabRef) for editing date fields in entries.
