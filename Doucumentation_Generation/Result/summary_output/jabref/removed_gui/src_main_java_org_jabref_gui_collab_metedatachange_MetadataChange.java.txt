The `MetadataChange` class represents a metadata modification in a BibTeX database within JabRef. It extends `DatabaseChange` to handle metadata differences (`MetaDataDiff`), tracks changes, and applies them to the database context. The class preserves original group structures while updating other metadata and provides access to the metadata differences. The change is labeled as "Metadata change" for localization purposes. Note that undo functionality is not yet implemented.
