The `MoveGroupChange` class tracks the movement of a group node in a tree structure. It stores the original parent node and child index (`oldParent`, `oldChildIndex`) and the new parent node and child index (`newParent`, `newChildIndex`) after the move. The class provides getter methods to access these values, enabling tracking or reverting of group node movements in JabRef's group hierarchy.
