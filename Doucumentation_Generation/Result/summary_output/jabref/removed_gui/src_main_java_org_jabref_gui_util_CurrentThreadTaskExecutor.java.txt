The `CurrentThreadTaskExecutor` executes tasks sequentially on the current thread (synchronously) rather than asynchronously. It handles background tasks by running their callbacks (`onRunning`, `onSuccess`, `onException`) immediately and returns completed or failed futures. It also manages `DelayTaskThrottler` instances for delayed tasks and provides shutdown functionality. Primarily used for testing, it ensures deterministic execution of async operations.
