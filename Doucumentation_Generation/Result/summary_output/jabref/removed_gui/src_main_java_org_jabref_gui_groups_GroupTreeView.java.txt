The `GroupTreeView` class implements a JavaFX-based UI component for managing and displaying groups of bibliographic entries in JabRef. Key features include:

1. A tree view showing groups with icons, hit counts, and expansion controls
2. Drag-and-drop support for reorganizing groups and adding entries
3. Context menu actions for group management (add/edit/remove groups, add/remove entries)
4. Search/filter functionality for groups
5. Visual indicators for selected/matched entries
6. Custom scrolling behavior during drag operations

The component integrates with JabRef's state management, preferences, and dialog systems while providing a responsive interface for group operations.
