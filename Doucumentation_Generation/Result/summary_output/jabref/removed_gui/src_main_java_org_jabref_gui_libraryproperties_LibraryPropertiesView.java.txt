This JavaFX code defines a dialog window for managing library properties in JabRef. It displays multiple tabs (each as a `ScrollPane`) for different property categories, initializes their values from the database context, and saves changes when the user clicks the save button. The dialog's title reflects the library filename, and it integrates with JabRef's theme system for consistent styling. The `LibraryPropertiesViewModel` handles the underlying logic for property management.
