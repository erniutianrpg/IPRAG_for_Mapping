The `ViewModelListCellFactory` class is a flexible factory for creating customized `ListCell` instances in JavaFX. It provides builder-style methods to configure cell properties like text, graphics, tooltips, context menus, styling, mouse/drag events, and validation states. The factory converts view model objects (`T`) into visual cell components using various callbacks. It supports dynamic updates through observable properties and can be installed on `ListView` or `ComboBox` components. The implementation handles cell updates and manages subscriptions to prevent memory leaks.
