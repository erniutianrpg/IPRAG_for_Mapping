This JavaFX view model class `CopyFilesResultItemViewModel` represents the result of a file copy operation. It stores the file path, a success/failure message, and an icon (checkmark for success, warning for failure). The class provides property getters for UI binding and a toString() method for debugging. It's used to display file copy operation results in JabRef's GUI.
