The `AboutAction` class is a GUI command that displays an "About" dialog in JabRef. When executed, it creates and shows a custom dialog (`AboutDialogView`) using the application's `DialogService`. The class extends `SimpleCommand`, making it an actionable command, and provides access to the dialog view via `getAboutDialogView()`. The dialog is instantiated once when the action is created.
