The `GroupNodeViewModel` class represents a view model for group nodes in JabRef's group hierarchy. It manages group display properties (name, icon, color), tracks matched BibTeX entries, handles group expansion/collapse, and supports drag-and-drop operations for reorganizing groups. The class also maintains relationships between parent and child groups, updates matched entries when the database changes, and provides binding properties for UI synchronization. Key functionalities include group manipulation (adding subgroups, moving groups), entry assignment to groups, and search/filter capabilities.
