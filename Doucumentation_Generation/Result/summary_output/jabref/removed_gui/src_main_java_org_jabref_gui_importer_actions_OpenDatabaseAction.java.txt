The `OpenDatabaseAction` class handles opening BibTeX database files in JabRef. It provides functionality to:
1. Open single or multiple database files via file dialog
2. Check for and handle already open files
3. Perform post-open actions like migrations and entry type checks
4. Restore from backup if available
5. Support shared databases with error handling
6. Track opened databases via telemetry
The code runs file operations in background threads to prevent UI freezing and maintains file history.
