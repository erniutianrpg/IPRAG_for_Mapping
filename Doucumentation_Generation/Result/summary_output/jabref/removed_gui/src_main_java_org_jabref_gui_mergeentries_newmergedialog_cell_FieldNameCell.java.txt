The `FieldNameCell` class is a JavaFX component that displays a read-only field name in a three-way merge UI. It extends `ThreeWayMergeCell` and consists of a label (bound to a text property) and an optional side button in an HBox layout. The label grows to fill available space, while the action area can hold a single button. The cell is styled with a default CSS class "field-name".
