The `FileAnnotationViewModel` class is a JavaFX-based view model for displaying PDF file annotations in JabRef. It processes annotation data (author, page, date, content) from `FileAnnotation` objects, formats the content by removing hyphens and newlines, and handles linked annotations. The class provides properties for UI binding and custom string representations for different annotation types (underline, highlight). It also localizes text and handles cases where marked text is illegible.
