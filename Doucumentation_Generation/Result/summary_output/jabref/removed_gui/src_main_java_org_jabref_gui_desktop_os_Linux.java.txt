This code provides Linux-specific implementations for file and system operations in the JabRef application. It handles opening files with default or specified applications, opening folders and selecting files (with desktop environment detection), launching terminals, and providing default directories. The class uses `xdg-open` as a fallback for file operations and supports various Linux desktop environments (GNOME, KDE, MATE, Cinnamon) with their native file managers. It also includes methods to detect terminal emulators and manage application paths/directories.
