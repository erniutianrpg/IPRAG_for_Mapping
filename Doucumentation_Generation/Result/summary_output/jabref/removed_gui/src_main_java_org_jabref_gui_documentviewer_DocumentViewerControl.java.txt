The `DocumentViewerControl` class is a JavaFX component that displays a scrollable document with multiple pages. It uses a `VirtualFlow` for efficient rendering of pages, tracks the currently visible page, and supports dynamic resizing of pages. Each page (`DocumentViewerPage`) is rendered as an image with a progress indicator, fading transitions for smooth loading, and adjustable dimensions. The control maintains page navigation, scroll position, and handles background rendering tasks for performance.
