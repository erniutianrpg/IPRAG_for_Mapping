This code manages field formatting cleanups for BibTeX entries in JabRef. It provides predefined cleanup actions (like normalizing dates, pages, and converting HTML to LaTeX) and parses/serializes cleanup configurations. The main class `FieldFormatterCleanups` handles enabling/disabling cleanups, applying them to entries, and converting between string representations and cleanup actions. It supports both BibTeX and BibLaTeX recommendations while maintaining immutability and thread safety.
