This code creates a context menu for text input fields in JabRef, offering text manipulation options. The menu includes: 
1) Case-changing functions (e.g., uppercase, lowercase)
2) Text conversion tools 
3) A protected terms menu 
4) A field-clearing option. 
Each menu item is enabled/disabled based on whether the text field contains content, and tooltips provide descriptions of each function. The menu is built when `get()` is called and is tied to a specific text input control.
