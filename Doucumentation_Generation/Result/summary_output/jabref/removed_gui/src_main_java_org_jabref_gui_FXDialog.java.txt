The `FXDialog` class is a base class for JavaFX dialogs in JabRef, extending JavaFX's `Alert` class. It provides constructors to create modal/non-modal dialogs with customizable titles, icons, and alert types. Key features include:
- Setting dialog icons (defaulting to JabRef's icon)
- Handling window close events
- Supporting modality (blocking/non-blocking)
- Adding a keyboard shortcut (CLOSE key binding) to close the dialog
- Simplifying dialog creation through chained constructors

The class is designed to be extended for custom dialogs loaded via FXML.
