The `CleanupPresetPanel` class is a JavaFX UI component for managing bibliography cleanup preferences in JabRef. It provides checkboxes for various cleanup actions (e.g., DOI cleanup, file renaming, path conversion) and handles their mutual exclusivity (e.g., BibTeX vs. BibLaTeX conversion). The panel initializes with user preferences, updates the UI accordingly, and allows users to select cleanup options which are then returned as a `CleanupPreferences` object. It also manages file operations relative to the database context.
