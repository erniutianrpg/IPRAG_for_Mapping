This JavaFX ViewModel class manages save order preferences for entries in JabRef. It provides three save options (original, table, or specified order) as boolean properties and maintains a list of sortable fields and selected sort criteria. The class includes methods to add, remove, and reorder sort criteria (move up/down) through list operations. The properties are exposed for data binding with UI controls.
