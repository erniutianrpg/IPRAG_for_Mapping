The `PdfDocumentViewModel` class extends `DocumentViewModel` to handle PDF documents in a JavaFX application. It takes a `PDDocument` (from Apache PDFBox) as input, sets the total page count, and provides an observable list of `DocumentPageViewModel` objects. Each page is wrapped in a `PdfDocumentPageViewModel` with its content, index, and document reference. This enables viewing and managing PDF pages in a reactive UI. The code essentially bridges PDFBox's document model with JavaFX's observable collections for GUI display. (98 words)
