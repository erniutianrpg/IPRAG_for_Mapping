This JavaFX dialog manages citations in JabRef's OpenOffice integration. It displays citations in a table with editable extra information. The dialog initializes with citation data, formats text with bold sections, and saves changes when OK is clicked. The `isOkToShowThisDialog` checks if citations were loaded successfully. It uses a ViewModel pattern to separate UI from logic and binds table data bidirectionally.
