This code provides context menu functionality for text fields in a JavaFX application (JabRef). It includes three specialized menus:

1. `getNameMenu`: Adds a "Normalize to BibTeX name format" option to format names according to BibTeX rules.
2. `getDOIMenu`: Adds options to copy DOI or DOI URL from a text field.
3. `getCleanupUrlMenu`: Adds a "Cleanup URL link" option to format URLs properly.

Each menu is lazily instantiated upon first right-click using `Supplier`. The menus combine specialized actions with default menu items.
