The `FieldMergerFactory` class creates specific merger implementations for different BibTeX fields (GROUPS, KEYWORDS, COMMENT, FILE) based on the input field type. It uses `BibEntryPreferences` for the KEYWORDS merger. The `canMerge()` method checks if a given field is mergeable. If no merger exists for a field, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException`. This factory pattern centralizes the creation of field-specific mergers in a BibTeX entry merging system. (98 words)
