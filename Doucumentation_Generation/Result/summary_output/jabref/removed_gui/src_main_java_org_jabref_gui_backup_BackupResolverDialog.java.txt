The `BackupResolverDialog` class creates a JavaFX dialog that appears when a backup file is detected for a given file. It offers three options: restore from backup, review the backup file, or ignore it. The dialog displays information about the backup file location and suggests possible unclean shutdown. If the user clicks the backup filename hyperlink, it attempts to open the backup file's location in the system file explorer. The class handles backup file path resolution and user interaction for backup recovery scenarios.
