The `EntryChangeResolver` class handles resolving conflicts between different versions of a bibliographic entry in JabRef. It presents a merge dialog to users, showing differences between the existing entry ("In JabRef") and the modified entry ("On disk"). Users can interactively merge changes, and the result is mapped back to an `EntryChange` object. The class utilizes preferences for display settings and diff highlighting (split view with word-level differences). The resolution occurs through a custom dialog service.
