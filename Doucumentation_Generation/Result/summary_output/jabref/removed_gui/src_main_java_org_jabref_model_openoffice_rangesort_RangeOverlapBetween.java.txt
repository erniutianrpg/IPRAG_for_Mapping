This code checks for overlaps between text ranges in a LibreOffice/OpenOffice document. It compares two lists of text range holders (`fewHolders` and `manyHolders`) and returns the first detected overlap (if any). The comparison considers whether ranges are equal, touching, or overlapping, with an option to include/exclude touching ranges. The result is a list of `RangeOverlap` objects describing the overlap type and involved ranges. The implementation minimizes calls to the LibreOffice API for efficiency.
