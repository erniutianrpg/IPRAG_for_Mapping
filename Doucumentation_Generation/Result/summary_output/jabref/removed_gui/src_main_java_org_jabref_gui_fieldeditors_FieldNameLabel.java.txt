The `FieldNameLabel` class extends JavaFX's `Label` to display field names in a GUI, with tooltips providing localized descriptions for each field type (Standard, Internal, or Special). It sets visual properties like padding and alignment, and dynamically generates tooltips with field descriptions that wrap text and adapt to screen width. The descriptions are fetched based on the field type through a comprehensive `getDescription` method that covers various bibliographic fields.
