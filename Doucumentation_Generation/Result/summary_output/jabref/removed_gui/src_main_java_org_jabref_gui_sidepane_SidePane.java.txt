The `SidePane` class manages a dynamic sidebar in a JavaFX application. It maintains a list of visible side pane components (`SidePaneType`) and updates the view when changes occur. The class provides methods to check pane visibility (`paneVisibleBinding`) and toggle panes (`getToggleCommandFor`). It uses `StateManager` to track visible components and `SidePaneViewModel` to handle component logic. The view is updated automatically when the visible components list changes.
