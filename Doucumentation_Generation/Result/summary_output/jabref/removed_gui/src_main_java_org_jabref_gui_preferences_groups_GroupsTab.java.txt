This JavaFX code defines a `GroupsTab` class for a preferences dialog in JabRef, specifically for group-related settings. It provides UI controls (radio buttons and checkboxes) to configure group view modes (intersection/union), auto-assign groups, and display group counts. The tab initializes with saved preferences and binds UI elements to a view model for two-way data synchronization. The tab's title is localized as "Groups".
