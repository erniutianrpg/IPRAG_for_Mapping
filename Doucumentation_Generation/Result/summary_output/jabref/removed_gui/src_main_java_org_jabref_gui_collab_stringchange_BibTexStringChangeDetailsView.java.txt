This JavaFX code creates a detailed view for displaying changes to a BibTeX string in JabRef. It shows a header ("Modified string") followed by the string's label, new content, and current (old) content in a vertical layout (VBox). The view is anchored with 8-pixel margins and uses localization for multilingual support. It extends `DatabaseChangeDetailsView` to present string modification details in JabRef's change detection interface.
