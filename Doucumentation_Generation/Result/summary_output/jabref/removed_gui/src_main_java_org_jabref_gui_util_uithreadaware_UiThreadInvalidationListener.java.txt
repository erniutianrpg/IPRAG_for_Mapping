The `UiThreadInvalidationListener` class wraps an `InvalidationListener` to ensure its `invalidated` method is executed on the JavaFX UI thread. It delegates all operations (including `equals` and `hashCode`) to the wrapped listener but uses `UiThreadHelper` to enforce UI thread execution for invalidation events. This is useful for JavaFX applications where UI updates must occur on the UI thread.
