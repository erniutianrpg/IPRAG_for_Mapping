The `FieldColumn` class represents a column in a main table that displays field values from BibTeX entries. It parses field qualifiers, sets up cell value factories to display text, and applies numeric comparison for sorting if the field is numeric or unknown. The column is sortable and displays field names as column headers. It handles single or multiple fields and returns appropriate display names and values for table cells.
