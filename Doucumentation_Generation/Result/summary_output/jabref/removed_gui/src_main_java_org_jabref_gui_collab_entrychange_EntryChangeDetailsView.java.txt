This JavaFX class `EntryChangeDetailsView` displays a side-by-side comparison of two versions of a BibTeX entry (old vs. new) in JabRef. It shows previews with source tabs for each version, synchronized so that tab selections match. The left pane displays the in-app version ("In JabRef"), while the right shows the disk version ("On disk"). The layout uses a horizontal split pane with consistent padding. The class leverages JabRef's preview functionality and maintains tab selection synchronization between both versions.
