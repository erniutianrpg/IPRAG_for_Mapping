This code defines a `ViewModelTreeTableRowFactory` class that creates customizable rows for a JavaFX `TreeTableView`. It provides methods to configure various row behaviors, including mouse click/press events, context menus, drag-and-drop operations, and pseudo-class styling. The factory allows attaching event handlers for different interactions and dynamically updates row appearance based on conditions. The `call` method creates and configures each row with the specified behaviors when the table updates its items.
