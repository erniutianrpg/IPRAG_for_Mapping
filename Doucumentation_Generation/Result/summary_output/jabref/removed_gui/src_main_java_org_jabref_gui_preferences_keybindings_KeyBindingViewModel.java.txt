The `KeyBindingViewModel` class manages key bindings in a JavaFX application, serving as a view model for `KeyBinding` objects. It handles displaying and modifying keyboard shortcuts, including validating new key combinations, resetting to defaults, and clearing bindings. The class supports both individual key bindings and categories, with properties for display names and current bindings. It interacts with a `KeyBindingRepository` to persist changes and provides icons for reset/clear actions when applicable.
