The `SaveOrderConfigPanel` class is a JavaFX component that provides a UI for configuring save order preferences in JabRef. It offers three radio buttons for choosing between original order, table order, or a custom specified order. When custom order is selected, users can add, remove, and reorder sort criteria (field + direction) in a grid. The panel binds to a ViewModel that manages the state and logic, including field selection and criterion management. The UI dynamically updates based on user interactions with the criteria list.
