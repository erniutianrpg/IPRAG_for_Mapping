This code manages citations in an OpenOffice/LibreOffice document through a JavaFX dialog. The `ManageCitationsDialogViewModel` class retrieves citation entries from `OOBibBase`, converts them to view models, and stores them in an observable list. If retrieval fails, it sets a flag (`failedToGetCitationEntries`). The `storeSettings` method applies any changes back to the document. The class provides a property for the citations list to enable UI binding. Essentially, it bridges between OpenOffice citations and a JavaFX UI for management. (98 words)
