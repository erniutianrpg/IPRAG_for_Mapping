The `ManageStudyDefinitionViewModel` class provides a model for managing Systematic Literature Review (SLR) study definitions in JabRef. It handles study metadata like title, authors, research questions, search queries, and selected databases. The class offers methods to add/remove these elements and save the study configuration to a YAML file in a specified directory. It supports both new studies (with default database selections) and existing studies (loaded from file). The model integrates with JabRef's fetchers for academic databases and includes Git commit functionality for version control of study definitions.
