This JavaFX code defines a dialog window for string replacement in JabRef. The `ReplaceStringView` class provides a UI with fields to input search/replace strings, options to limit replacement scope (all fields or selected fields only), and a replace button. The view binds UI controls to a `ReplaceStringViewModel` for data handling. When the replace button is clicked, it triggers the replacement operation if a search string is provided, then closes the dialog. The class includes validation visualization for input fields.
