This code implements a duplicate search functionality for bibliographic entries in JabRef. It searches for duplicate entries in a database, compares them, and provides options to resolve duplicates (keep one, merge, keep both, etc.). The process runs in background threads, shows progress, and supports undo operations. Found duplicates are processed through a dialog where users can choose resolution strategies. Exact duplicates can be auto-removed. The results are tracked in a `DuplicateSearchResult` object which manages entries to remove/add.
