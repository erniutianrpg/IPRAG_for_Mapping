This code defines a `PushToTeXstudio` class that enables pushing citations from JabRef (a reference manager) to TeXstudio (a LaTeX editor). It extends `AbstractPushToApplication` and specifies TeXstudio's name, icon, and the command-line format for inserting citations. The command constructs a string with the citation keys formatted for LaTeX (`\cite{keys}`) and sends it to TeXstudio via its `--insert-cite` flag. This integration allows seamless citation insertion from JabRef into TeXstudio documents. (98 words)
