The `OOVoidResult<E>` class represents a result that can either be successful (OK) or contain an error of type `E`. It provides methods to check the result status (`isError()`, `isOK()`), retrieve the error (`getError()`), handle errors (`ifError()`), and transform errors (`mapError()`). The class uses `Optional<E>` internally to manage the error state, with static factory methods `ok()` and `error()` for creating instances. Essentially, it's a simple monadic container for void operations that may fail, allowing error handling without exceptions.
