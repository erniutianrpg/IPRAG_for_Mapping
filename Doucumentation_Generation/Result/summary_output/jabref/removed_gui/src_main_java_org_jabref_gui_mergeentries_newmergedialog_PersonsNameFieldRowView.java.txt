This code defines a `PersonsNameFieldRowView` class for handling person name fields in a merge entries dialog. It parses author names from left and right BibTeX entries, checks if they're semantically equal despite formatting differences, and displays an info button if they are. The class extends `FieldRowView` and specifically handles fields marked with `PERSON_NAMES` property, providing visual feedback when names are identical but ordered differently.
