The `ErrorConsoleAction` class opens a custom error console dialog in JabRef to display log output, helping users report bugs without needing command-line access. When executed, it instantiates a `DialogService` and displays an `ErrorConsoleView` window. This provides a GUI-based way to view error logs, particularly useful for Windows users.
