The `NewVersionDialog` class creates a popup dialog that informs users about a new JabRef version. It displays current and latest version numbers, a changelog hyperlink, and provides three options: download the update, ignore it, or be reminded later. If users choose to download, it opens the download URL in a browser. The dialog is localized and has a preferred width of 450 pixels. The result converter returns `false` if ignored, otherwise `true`.
