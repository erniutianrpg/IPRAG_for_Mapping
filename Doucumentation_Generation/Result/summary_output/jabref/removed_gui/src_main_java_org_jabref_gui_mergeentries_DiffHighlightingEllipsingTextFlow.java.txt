This JavaFX `TextFlow` subclass (`DiffHighlightingEllipsingTextFlow`) displays text with diff highlighting and ellipsis truncation. It compares `fullText` against a `comparisonString` and highlights differences either by word or character (based on `DiffMode`). The component dynamically adjusts text display to fit within bounds by truncating with ellipses when needed. Key features include: diff highlighting, responsive resizing, and customizable ellipsis strings. The class handles text overflow by progressively removing content until it fits or adding ellipsis to the last visible portion.
