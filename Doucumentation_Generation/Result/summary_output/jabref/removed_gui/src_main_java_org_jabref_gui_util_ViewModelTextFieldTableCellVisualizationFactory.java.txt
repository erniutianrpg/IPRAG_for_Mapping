This code creates a custom JavaFX `TableCell` factory for table columns that supports text editing and validation. Key features include:
1. Validates input using a provided `ValidationStatus` function
2. Highlights invalid cells with a pseudo-class
3. Shows validation error messages as tooltips
4. Focuses and selects text when editing starts
5. Handles cleanup of subscriptions when cells update
6. Works with both simple text fields and HBox layouts containing graphics

The factory extends `TextFieldTableCell` to provide enhanced visualization and validation capabilities for table cells.
