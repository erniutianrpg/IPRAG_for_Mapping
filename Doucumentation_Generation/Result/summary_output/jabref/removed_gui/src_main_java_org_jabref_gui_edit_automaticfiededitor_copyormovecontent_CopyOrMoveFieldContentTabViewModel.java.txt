This code implements a view model for a tab that handles copying, moving, or swapping field content between BibTeX entries in JabRef. It provides functionality to:
1. Copy values from one field to another
2. Move values between fields (with overwrite option)
3. Swap values between two fields
4. Validate target field names
5. Track undoable edits and affected entries
6. Manage UI state through JavaFX properties and bindings

The class maintains selected entries, source/target fields, and overwrite preferences while ensuring valid operations through property bindings.
