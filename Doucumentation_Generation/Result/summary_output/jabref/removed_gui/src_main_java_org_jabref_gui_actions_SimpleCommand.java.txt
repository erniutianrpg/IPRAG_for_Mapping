The `SimpleCommand` class extends `CommandBase` to create a basic command implementation without progress tracking. It provides a status message property with getter and property accessor methods. The command's progress methods return fixed values (0 or null) since it doesn't track progress. The `setExecutable` method allows setting the command's executability state. This serves as a base for simple commands that don't need progress monitoring but may need status updates and executability control. (98 words)
