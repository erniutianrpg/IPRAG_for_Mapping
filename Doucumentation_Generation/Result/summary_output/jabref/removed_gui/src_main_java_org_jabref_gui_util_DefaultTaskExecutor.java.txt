The `DefaultTaskExecutor` class manages concurrent task execution in a JavaFX application. It provides methods to:
1. Run tasks in background threads using a fixed thread pool
2. Schedule delayed tasks
3. Execute tasks on the JavaFX application thread (with sync/async options)
4. Manage task throttling with `DelayTaskThrottler`
5. Track background tasks via `StateManager`
6. Handle task cancellation and shutdown

It bridges JavaFX's `Task` with custom `BackgroundTask` implementations, providing progress tracking and callback handling for success/exception cases. The executor manages two thread pools (5 fixed + 2 scheduled threads) for concurrent operations.
