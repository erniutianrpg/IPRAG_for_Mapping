The `CitationKeyEditor` class is a JavaFX component for editing citation keys in JabRef. It provides a text field for manual entry and a button to auto-generate citation keys. The editor binds to a BibEntry, validates input using field checkers, supports undo/redo, and integrates with JabRef's preferences and dialog services. The view model handles business logic, while the UI synchronizes with it via bidirectional binding. The generate button is configured with an action command from the view model.
