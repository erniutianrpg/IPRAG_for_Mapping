The `FieldsEditorTab` class is an abstract tab component for JabRef's entry editor that displays and manages field editors for BibTeX entries. It handles:

1. Creating a grid layout for field labels and editors
2. Supporting both compressed (2-column) and regular (1-column) layouts
3. Binding field editors to BibEntry data
4. Managing focus between fields
5. Optional preview panel integration
6. Dynamic field display based on entry type

The class serves as a base for specialized entry editor tabs, with `determineFieldsToShow()` implemented by subclasses to specify which fields to display.
