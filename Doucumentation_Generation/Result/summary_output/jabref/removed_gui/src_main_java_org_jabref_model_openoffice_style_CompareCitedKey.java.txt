The `CompareCitedKey` class implements a comparator for `ComparableCitedKey` objects that wraps a `BibEntry` comparator. It handles both resolved and unresolved citation keys: if both keys are unresolved, it compares them by citation key; if one is unresolved, it places it first or last based on `unresolvedComesFirst`; otherwise, it uses the provided `BibEntry` comparator. This enables flexible sorting of citations with optional prioritization of unresolved references. (98 words)
