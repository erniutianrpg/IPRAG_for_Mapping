The `UnifiedDiffHighlighter` class highlights differences between two text areas by unifying changes (insertions, deletions, modifications) into a single target view. It uses a diff algorithm to compare source and target text, then visually marks changes with different styles (e.g., "addition" or "deletion"). Modifications are represented as deletions followed by insertions. The class ensures proper formatting by handling separators and applying CSS styles to differentiate between unchanged, added, and deleted text segments. The result is a unified view where all differences are clearly highlighted in the target text area.
