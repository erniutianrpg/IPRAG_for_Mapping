The `UserDefinedFieldsTab` class is a custom entry editor tab in JabRef that displays user-defined fields for a BibEntry. It extends `FieldsEditorTab` and initializes with a set of specified fields. The tab shows these predefined fields regardless of the entry type, with an optional icon. It inherits core functionality from the parent class while overriding `determineFieldsToShow()` to return its fixed set of fields. The class integrates with JabRef's UI components, preferences, and services like undo management and autocompletion.
