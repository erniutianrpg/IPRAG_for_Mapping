This Java class `EntryWithPreviewAndSourceDetailsView` extends `DatabaseChangeDetailsView` to display a BibTeX entry's preview and source code in a tabbed pane. It uses `PreviewWithSourceTab` to create a tab pane with both preview and source views of the entry, anchored with 8-pixel margins. The class takes a `BibEntry`, database context, preferences, entry types manager, and preview viewer as inputs to configure the display. The tab pane is then set as the sole child of the view.
