This code implements an action to export selected BibTeX entries to the system clipboard in various formats (like HTML, RTF, XML, etc.). It shows a dialog to choose the export format, creates a temporary file for the export, reads its content, and copies it to the clipboard. Supported formats are text-based, and the last used format is remembered as the default. Errors are logged and shown to the user. The operation runs in the background to avoid UI freezing.
