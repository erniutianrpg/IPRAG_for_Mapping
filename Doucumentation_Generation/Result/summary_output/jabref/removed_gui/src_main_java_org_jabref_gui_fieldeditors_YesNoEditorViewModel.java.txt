The `YesNoEditorViewModel` class is a field editor for handling yes/no values in JabRef. It extends `MapBasedEditorViewModel` and uses a bidirectional map to store "yes"/"No" and "no"/"No" pairs. The class provides methods to access this map and convert values to display text. Essentially, it manages the mapping between internal values ("yes"/"no") and their display representations ("Yes"/"No") for a field in the JabRef bibliography manager. (94 words)
