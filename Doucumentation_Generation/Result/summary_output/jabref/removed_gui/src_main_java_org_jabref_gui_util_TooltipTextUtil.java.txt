This utility class processes text for JavaFX tooltips by converting HTML-like formatted strings (with `<tt>`, `<b>`, and `<i>` tags) into styled `Text` objects. It supports monospaced, bold, and italic styles, and can split/replace text segments while preserving formatting. The class also converts styled `Text` back to HTML strings. Key methods include `createTextsFromHtml()` for parsing formatted strings and `formatToTexts()` for replacing text segments with styled versions.
