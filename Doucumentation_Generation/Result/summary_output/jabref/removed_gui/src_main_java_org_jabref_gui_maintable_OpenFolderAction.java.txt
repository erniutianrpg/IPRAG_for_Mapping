The `OpenFolderAction` class is a command that opens the folder containing linked files for BibTeX entries in JabRef. It checks if files exist for selected entries (when no specific file is provided) and executes the action by creating a `LinkedFileViewModel` to handle the folder opening. The action can operate on either a specific file/entry or the currently selected entries in the GUI. It uses dependency injection for services like dialog handling, state management, and preferences.
