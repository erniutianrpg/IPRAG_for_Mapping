This JavaFX class `ConstantsPropertiesView` manages a tab for editing string constants in a library properties interface. It displays a table of string entries with labels and content, allowing users to add, edit, and delete entries. The view includes validation for duplicate labels and empty content, with buttons for adding strings and accessing help. The table is editable, with changes bound to a view model (`ConstantsPropertiesViewModel`) that handles the underlying data operations. The tab integrates with JabRef's preferences and localization systems.
