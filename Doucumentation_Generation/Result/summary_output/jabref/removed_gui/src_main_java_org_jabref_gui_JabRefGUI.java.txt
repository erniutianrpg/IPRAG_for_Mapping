The `JabRefGUI` class initializes and manages the main GUI window for JabRef, a reference management software. It handles window positioning, size, and state (maximized/normal), applies CSS themes, and sets up key bindings. The class opens databases from command-line arguments or last-edited files, handles shared database connections, displays warnings/errors, and performs post-open actions. It also manages proxy authentication and version checks. The window state is saved on close. The main frame (`JabRefFrame`) is accessible globally.
