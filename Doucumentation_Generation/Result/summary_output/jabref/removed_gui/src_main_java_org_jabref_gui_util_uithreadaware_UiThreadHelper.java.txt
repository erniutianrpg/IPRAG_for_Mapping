The `UiThreadHelper` class ensures a given task (`Runnable`) is executed on the JavaFX UI thread. If the current thread is already the JavaFX application thread, it runs the task immediately. Otherwise, it schedules the task to run later on the UI thread using `Platform.runLater()`. This prevents UI updates from non-UI threads, which could cause errors. (49 words)
