This JavaFX class `OpenHyperlinksInExternalBrowser` intercepts click events on hyperlinks (`<a>` tags) within a `WebView` component and opens them in the system's default external browser instead. It implements `ChangeListener` to monitor the WebView's loading state and `EventListener` to handle click events. When a link is clicked, it prevents the default WebView behavior and uses `JabRefDesktop.openBrowser()` to open the URL externally. This is useful for ensuring links open in a proper browser rather than within the application's WebView.
