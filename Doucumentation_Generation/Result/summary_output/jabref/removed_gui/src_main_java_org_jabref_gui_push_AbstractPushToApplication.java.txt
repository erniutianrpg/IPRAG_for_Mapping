This abstract class provides core functionality for pushing BibTeX entries to external applications in JabRef. It handles command execution (with OS-specific handling for macOS), error management (undefined paths, connection issues), and user notifications. The class requires subclasses to implement application-specific details like command-line generation (`getCommandLine()`) and display names. It uses preferences for application paths and citation commands, and provides a default action with icon and keybinding for UI integration.
