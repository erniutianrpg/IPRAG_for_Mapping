The `ConnectToSharedDatabaseCommand` class is a command that opens a shared database in the JabRef application. When executed, it displays a custom login dialog (`SharedDatabaseLoginDialogView`) for connecting to a shared database, using the `DialogService` for dialog handling. The command relies on the main `JabRefFrame` for context.
