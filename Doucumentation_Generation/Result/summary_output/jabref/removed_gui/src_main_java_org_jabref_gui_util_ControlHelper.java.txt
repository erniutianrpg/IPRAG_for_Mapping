The `ControlHelper` class provides utility methods for JavaFX UI controls. Key functionalities include: setting button actions with event consumption, checking if a child node is focused, creating a text formatter for integers, managing drag-and-drop pseudo-classes (top/center/bottom) for cells, and truncating strings with ellipsis at different positions (beginning, center, or end). It simplifies common UI tasks like input validation, focus management, and visual feedback during drag operations.
