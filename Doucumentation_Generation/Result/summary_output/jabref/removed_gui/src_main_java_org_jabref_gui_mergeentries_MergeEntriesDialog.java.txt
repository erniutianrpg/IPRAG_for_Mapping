The `MergeEntriesDialog` class creates a JavaFX dialog for merging two BibTeX entries (`BibEntry`). It uses a `ThreeWayMergeView` to display and compare the entries, allowing users to merge them. The dialog includes "Merge entries" and "Cancel" buttons. When merged, it returns an `EntriesMergeResult` containing the original, modified, and merged entries. Additional methods let users set header texts and configure diff display options. The dialog is positioned at (20, 20) on the screen.
