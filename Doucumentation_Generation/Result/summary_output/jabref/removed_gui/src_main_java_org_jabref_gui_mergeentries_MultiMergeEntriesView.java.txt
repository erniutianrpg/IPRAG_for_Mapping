This JavaFX code implements a GUI dialog for merging multiple BibTeX entries in JabRef. It displays entries in columns, allowing users to select fields from different sources to create a merged entry. Key features include:

1. Three-pane view (left: field names, center: source entries, right: merged entry editor)
2. Supports diff highlighting modes (plain/word/character)
3. Allows field selection via toggle buttons
4. Handles both single-line and multi-line fields
5. Includes DOI lookup functionality
6. Shows loading states for async operations

The dialog returns the merged BibEntry when confirmed. It's part of JabRef's reference management system for combining metadata from different sources.
