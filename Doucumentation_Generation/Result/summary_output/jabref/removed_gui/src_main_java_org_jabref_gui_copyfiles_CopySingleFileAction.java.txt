The `CopySingleFileAction` class handles copying a single linked file from a BibTeX database to a user-selected directory. It checks if the file exists locally, prompts the user to choose a destination folder, and attempts to copy the file. Success or error messages are displayed via a dialog service. The action is only executable for local files (not online links) that exist in the database.
