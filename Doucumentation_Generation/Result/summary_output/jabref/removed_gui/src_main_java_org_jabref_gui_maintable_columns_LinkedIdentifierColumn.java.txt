The `LinkedIdentifierColumn` class creates a column in a table for displaying clickable icons representing linked identifiers (DOIs, URLs, URIs, EPrints) in bibliographic entries. It shows different icons based on the number of links (single link or multiple links). Clicking a single link opens it directly, while multiple links show a context menu to select which one to open. Tooltips display identifier details. The column integrates with JabRef's UI and handles link opening via external viewers.
