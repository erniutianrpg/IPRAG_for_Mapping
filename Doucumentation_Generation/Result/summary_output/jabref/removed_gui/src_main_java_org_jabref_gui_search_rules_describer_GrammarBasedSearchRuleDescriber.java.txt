This code describes a grammar-based search rule for JabRef's search functionality. It generates a user-friendly description of search queries by parsing the search expression tree and converting it into formatted text. The description includes details like case sensitivity, field matches, and operators (AND/OR/NOT). It handles different comparison types (contains, exact match, regex) and formats the output with bold text for field names and search terms. The result is displayed as a TextFlow for GUI presentation.
