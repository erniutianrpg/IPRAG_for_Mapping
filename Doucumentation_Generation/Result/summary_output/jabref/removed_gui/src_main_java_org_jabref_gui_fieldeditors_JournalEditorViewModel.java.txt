The `JournalEditorViewModel` class manages journal name fields in JabRef, providing functionality to toggle between full journal names and their abbreviations. It uses a `JournalAbbreviationRepository` to look up abbreviations, ignoring any curly brackets in the text. When `toggleAbbreviation()` is called, it checks for non-blank text and updates the field with the next available abbreviation if found. The class extends `AbstractEditorViewModel` for basic field editor functionality.
