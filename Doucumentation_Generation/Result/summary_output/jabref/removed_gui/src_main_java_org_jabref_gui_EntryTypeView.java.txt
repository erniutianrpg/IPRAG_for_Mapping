This JavaFX dialog allows users to select an entry type (like Article, Book, etc.) for bibliographic entries in JabRef. It displays recommended and other entry types based on the database mode (BibTeX/BibLaTeX), shows custom types if available, and provides descriptions for each type. Users can also generate entries using ID-based fetchers (like DOI or ISBN). The selected type is returned when the dialog closes. The UI adapts to screen size and includes tooltips with type descriptions.
