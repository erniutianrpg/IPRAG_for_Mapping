The `IntegrityCheckDialogViewModel` class is a ViewModel that manages a list of integrity messages for display in a dialog. It extends `AbstractViewModel` and wraps a provided list of `IntegrityMessage` objects into an observable JavaFX list (`ObservableList`) to enable UI binding and automatic updates. The class provides a getter method to access these messages. Essentially, it acts as a bridge between integrity check results and their presentation in the UI. (75 words)
