The `UnlinkedPDFFileFilter` class filters files to identify unlinked PDFs in a bibliography database. It checks if a file is a directory (allowed) or a file not linked to any `BibEntry` in the database (using `DatabaseFileLookup`). The filter first consults another provided `FileFilter` before verifying the file's unlinked status. It ensures the file isn't referenced in the database and isn't the database file itself. This helps find PDFs that exist in the filesystem but aren't linked to entries in the BibTeX database.
