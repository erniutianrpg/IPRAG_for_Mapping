This JavaFX component `LinkedEntriesEditor` is a custom field editor for managing linked bibliography entries in JabRef. It displays entries as interactive chips in a `JFXChipView`, allowing users to click chips to navigate to linked entries. The editor binds to a `LinkedEntriesEditorViewModel` for data management, supports auto-completion for entry keys, and ensures bidirectional synchronization between the UI and underlying data model. It integrates with JabRef's database context, suggestion provider, and field validation system.
