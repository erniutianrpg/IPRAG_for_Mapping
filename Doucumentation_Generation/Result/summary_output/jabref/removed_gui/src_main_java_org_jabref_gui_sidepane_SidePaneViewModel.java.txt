The `SidePaneViewModel` class manages the visibility, ordering, and positioning of side pane components in a JavaFX application. It handles showing/hiding panes, moving them up/down, and persists their preferred positions via preferences. The class uses a factory pattern to create different pane types (like Groups, Web Search) and maintains their state through a `StateManager`. It also provides commands for pane manipulation (move up, move down, close) and synchronizes with user preferences.
