The `UiThreadChangeListener` class wraps a JavaFX `ChangeListener` to ensure its `changed()` method is always executed on the UI thread. It delegates all operations to the original listener but uses `UiThreadHelper.ensureUiThreadExecution()` to guarantee thread safety. The `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods also delegate to the original listener. This is useful for JavaFX applications where UI updates must occur on the main thread.
