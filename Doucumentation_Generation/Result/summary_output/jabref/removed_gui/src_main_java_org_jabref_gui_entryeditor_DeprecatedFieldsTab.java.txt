The `DeprecatedFieldsTab` class in JabRef displays deprecated BibTeX fields that have modern alternatives in biblatex. It extends `FieldsEditorTab` and shows a tab with deprecated fields for a given bibliography entry. The tab includes a tooltip explaining its purpose, which changes based on user preferences. The `determineFieldsToShow` method filters and displays only deprecated fields that contain data, checking against the database mode (BibTeX/biblatex) and entry type. Fields are considered deprecated if they have successors in biblatex (e.g., publication month should be part of the date field).
