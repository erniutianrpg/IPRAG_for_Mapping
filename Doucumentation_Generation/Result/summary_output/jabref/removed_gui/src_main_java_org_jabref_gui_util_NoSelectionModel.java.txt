The `NoSelectionModel` class is a JavaFX `MultipleSelectionModel` implementation that disables all selection functionality. It overrides selection methods to do nothing and returns empty lists for selected items/indices. All selection checks return `false` or `empty`, effectively making the associated UI component non-selectable. This is useful when you want to display items without allowing user selection.
