The `CommentMerger` class implements a field merger for combining two comment strings from bibliographic entries. It concatenates the two input strings (`fieldValueA` and `fieldValueB`) with a newline character (platform-specific) in between, ensuring comments from different entries are separated cleanly. This is specifically for the `COMMENT` field in JabRef.
