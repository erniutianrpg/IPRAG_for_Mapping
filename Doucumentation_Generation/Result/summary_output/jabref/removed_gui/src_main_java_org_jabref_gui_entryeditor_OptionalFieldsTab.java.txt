The `OptionalFieldsTab` class extends `OptionalFieldsTabBase` to create a GUI tab for displaying optional fields in a BibTeX entry editor within the JabRef reference manager. It initializes the tab with localization, database context, and various services (undo, preferences, theming, etc.) required for functionality. The tab is marked as editable (`true`) and handles optional metadata fields for bibliographic entries.
