This code enables sending selected BibTeX entries as an email using the `mailto` protocol. It formats the entries into a string, attaches linked files (optionally opening their folders for email clients like Outlook that don't support attachments via `mailto`), and constructs a `mailto` URI with the entries as the email body and subject from preferences. The email is then opened in the default mail client. Error handling is included for unsupported operations or missing selections.
