This code defines an abstract base class `DatabaseChange` for tracking and managing changes in a BibTeX database. It supports various change types (like entry additions, deletions, metadata changes) through permitted subclasses. The class tracks whether a change is accepted via a boolean property, provides a name for the change, and optionally uses a resolver for handling conflicts. It also includes methods to apply changes with undo support via `NamedCompound`. The design allows for extensible change types while maintaining common functionality for acceptance and application of changes.
