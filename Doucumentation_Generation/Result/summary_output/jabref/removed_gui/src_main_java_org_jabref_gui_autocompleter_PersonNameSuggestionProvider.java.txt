This code provides auto-completion suggestions for author names in a bibliography database. It extracts author names from specified fields in BibTeX entries, processes them into `Author` objects, and offers suggestions based on user input. The suggestions are matched case-insensitively, sorted alphabetically, and compared by last name. The class works with a `BibDatabase` to fetch entries and supports multiple fields for author name extraction.
