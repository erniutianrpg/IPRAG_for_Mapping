The `ValueTableCellFactory` class is a JavaFX utility for creating customizable `TableCell` instances in a table. It provides fluent methods to configure cell properties like text, graphics, tooltips, mouse click events, context menus, and visibility/disable states. The factory converts cell values (type T) and row items (type S) into these properties using provided functions. When a cell updates, it applies these conversions to display content, handle interactions, and manage cell state dynamically. This offers a flexible way to customize table cells without subclassing `TableCell` repeatedly.
