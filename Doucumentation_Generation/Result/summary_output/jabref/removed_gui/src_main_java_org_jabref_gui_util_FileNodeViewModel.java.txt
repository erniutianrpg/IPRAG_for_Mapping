The `FileNodeViewModel` class represents a file or directory in a file system tree structure. It stores the file path, child nodes (for directories), and file count. Key functionalities include:
1. Formatting file modification timestamps (`formatDateTime`)
2. Generating display text with file count for directories or last edited time for files (`getDisplayText`, `getDisplayTextWithEditDate`)
3. Providing access to path, children, and file count properties
4. Implementing equals/hashCode for comparison

It's primarily used for displaying and managing file system entries in a JavaFX UI with localization support.
