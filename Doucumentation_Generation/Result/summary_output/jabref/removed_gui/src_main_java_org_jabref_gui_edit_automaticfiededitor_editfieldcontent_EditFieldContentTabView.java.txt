This JavaFX code defines a GUI tab (`EditFieldContentTabView`) for editing field contents in BibTeX entries within JabRef. It provides functionality to:
1. Select a field via a combo box
2. Set/append/clear field values via buttons
3. Toggle overwrite mode with a checkbox
4. Validate inputs and disable buttons when invalid
5. Bind UI elements to a view model (`EditFieldContentViewModel`) that handles the actual operations on selected entries

The tab integrates with JabRef's state management and database systems, supporting localization and input validation.
