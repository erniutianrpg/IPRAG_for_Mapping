The `ThreeWayMergeCell` class is a JavaFX `HBox` component that represents a cell in a three-way merge UI. It manages text content and row styling (odd/even) through a view model (`ThreeWayMergeCellViewModel`). The cell applies CSS pseudo-classes for alternating row colors and provides methods to get/set the cell's text. It serves as a base class for merge dialog cells, handling common functionality like text binding and row styling.
