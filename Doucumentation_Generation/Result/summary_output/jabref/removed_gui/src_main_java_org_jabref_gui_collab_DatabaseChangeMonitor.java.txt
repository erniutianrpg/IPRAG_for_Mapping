The `DatabaseChangeMonitor` class monitors changes to a BibTeX database file. When the file is modified externally, it scans for changes using `ChangeScanner` and notifies registered listeners (like a UI notification panel) about the modifications. Users can then dismiss or review the changes through a dialog. The class integrates with JabRef's file monitoring system and runs change detection in the background. It also provides methods to add listeners and unregister from file monitoring.
