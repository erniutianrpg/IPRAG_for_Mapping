This JavaFX class `ToggleMergeUnmergeButton` creates a toggle button for merging/unmerging fields in a UI. The button switches between merge and unmerge states, updating its icon and text accordingly. It uses `FieldState` (MERGED/UNMERGED) to track state and `canMerge` to enable/disable the button. The `ToggleMergeCommand` handles the toggle action, changing the button's appearance and state when clicked. The button is tied to a specific `Field` and displays localized text.
