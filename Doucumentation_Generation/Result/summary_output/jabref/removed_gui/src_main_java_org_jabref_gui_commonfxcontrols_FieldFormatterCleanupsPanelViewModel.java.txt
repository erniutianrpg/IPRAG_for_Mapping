This code defines a ViewModel class `FieldFormatterCleanupsPanelViewModel` for managing field formatter cleanups in a JavaFX UI. It provides properties for available fields and formatters, selected items, and a list of cleanup actions. The class supports adding, removing, clearing, and resetting cleanups (to BibTeX/BibLaTeX recommended defaults). It uses observable collections for UI binding and includes validation to prevent duplicate cleanups. The ViewModel acts as a bridge between the UI and cleanup logic in JabRef.
