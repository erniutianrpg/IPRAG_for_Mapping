The `ImportEntriesViewModel` class manages the import of bibliographic entries into a JabRef database. It handles parsing results, checks for duplicates, and resolves them via user dialogs. The class coordinates file downloads for linked entries, merges metadata, and updates the database. It provides progress feedback and user notifications during the import process, with options to handle duplicate entries through various resolution strategies (keep, merge, or cancel).
