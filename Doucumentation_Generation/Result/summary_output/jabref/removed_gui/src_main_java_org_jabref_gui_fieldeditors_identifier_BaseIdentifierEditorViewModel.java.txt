This code defines a base view model `BaseIdentifierEditorViewModel` for identifier field editors in JabRef. It provides core functionality for handling identifiers (like DOI, ISBN, etc.), including:

1. Parsing and validating identifiers
2. Looking up identifiers from external sources
3. Fetching bibliography information using identifiers
4. Opening external links associated with identifiers
5. Managing UI state through JavaFX properties
6. Handling errors during identifier operations

The class serves as an abstract base for specific identifier types, with methods that can be overridden by subclasses to implement type-specific behavior. It includes properties to track identifier validity, lookup progress, and available actions.
