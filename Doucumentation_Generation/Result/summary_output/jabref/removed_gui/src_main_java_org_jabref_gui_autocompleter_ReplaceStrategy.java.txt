The `ReplaceStrategy` class implements the `AutoCompletionStrategy` interface. Its `analyze` method takes a string input and returns an `AutoCompletionInput` object where the prefix is an empty string and the remaining text is the original input. This strategy effectively replaces any existing prefix with the entire input, suggesting it's designed for cases where auto-completion should consider the full input without any prefix filtering.
