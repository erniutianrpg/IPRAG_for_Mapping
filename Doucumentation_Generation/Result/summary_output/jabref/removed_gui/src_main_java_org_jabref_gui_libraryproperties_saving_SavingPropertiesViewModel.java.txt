The `SavingPropertiesViewModel` class manages saving-related properties for a bibliography database in JabRef. It handles two main aspects: 1) Save order configuration (original/table/specified order with sort criteria) and 2) Field cleanup operations during saving. The class implements `PropertiesTabViewModel` to load and store these settings to/from the database metadata, using JavaFX properties for UI binding. It also manages library protection status and integrates with JabRef's preferences system for default values.
