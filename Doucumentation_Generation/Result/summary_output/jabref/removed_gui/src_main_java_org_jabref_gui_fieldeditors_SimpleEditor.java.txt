The `SimpleEditor` class is a JavaFX-based field editor for BibTeX entries in JabRef. It provides a single-line or multi-line text input control (depending on `isMultiLine`) with features like:
- Bidirectional data binding to a view model
- Context menu support
- Auto-completion (with immediate suggestions for content selectors)
- Input validation
- Focus management
It extends `HBox` and implements `FieldEditorFX` to integrate with JabRef's GUI framework, supporting binding to BibEntry objects and field-specific operations.
