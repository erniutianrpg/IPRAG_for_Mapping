This code implements a custom comparator (`RankingFieldComparator`) that compares two `Optional<SpecialFieldValueViewModel>` objects representing rankings. It performs an inverse comparison (higher ranks come first) - if both values are present, it compares them and inverts the result. Absent values are ranked lower than present ones. For example, rank5 would be considered higher than rank1.
