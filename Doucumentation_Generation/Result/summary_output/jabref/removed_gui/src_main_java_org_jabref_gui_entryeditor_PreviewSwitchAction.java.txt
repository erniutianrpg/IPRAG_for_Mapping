This code defines a `PreviewSwitchAction` class that toggles between different preview styles in JabRef's entry editor. It extends `SimpleCommand` and takes a `Direction` (PREVIOUS or NEXT) to determine whether to cycle to the next or previous preview style. The action is only executable when a database is open. When executed, it calls `nextPreviewStyle()` or `previousPreviewStyle()` on the current entry editor based on the specified direction.
