The `FileAnnotationTabViewModel` class manages file annotations (like PDF comments) for a BibTeX entry in JabRef. It handles loading, caching, and monitoring annotation changes for associated files. Key features include: tracking annotations per file, sorting by page number, updating annotations when files change, and copying annotation details to clipboard. It uses JavaFX properties for UI binding and monitors files for real-time updates. The class also provides methods to access current annotations and check if annotations exist.
