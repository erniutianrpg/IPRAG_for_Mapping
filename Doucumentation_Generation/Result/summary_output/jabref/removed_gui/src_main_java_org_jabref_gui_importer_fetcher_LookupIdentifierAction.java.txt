This code defines a `LookupIdentifierAction` class that fetches identifiers (like DOIs or ISBNs) for selected BibTeX entries in JabRef. It uses a specified `IdFetcher` to look up identifiers for each entry, updates the entries with the found identifiers, and provides undo support. The action is executable only when entries are selected and shows progress notifications. The result summarizes how many identifiers were found.
