The `NewSubLibraryAction` class is a GUI command in JabRef that creates a new sub-database from a LaTeX AUX file. It extends `SimpleCommand` and checks if a database is open before execution. When triggered, it displays a custom dialog (`FromAuxDialog`) to facilitate the AUX file import process, using JabRef's main frame and dependency injection for the dialog service. The action is only executable when a database is active.
