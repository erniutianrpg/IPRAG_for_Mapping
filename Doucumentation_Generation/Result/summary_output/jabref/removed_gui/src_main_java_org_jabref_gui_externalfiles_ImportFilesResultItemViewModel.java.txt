This JavaFX class `ImportFilesResultItemViewModel` represents a view model for displaying file import results. It stores a file path, status message, and an icon (green check for success, red warning for failure). The class provides property getters for UI binding and a `toString()` method for debugging. It's used to visually represent the outcome of file import operations in JabRef's GUI.
