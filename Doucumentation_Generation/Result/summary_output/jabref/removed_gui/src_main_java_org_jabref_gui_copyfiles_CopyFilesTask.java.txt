This Java code defines a `CopyFilesTask` class that asynchronously copies files linked to BibTeX entries to a specified directory. It tracks progress, handles interruptions, logs operations to a file, and reports success/failure for each file copy. The task processes each entry's linked files, resolves their paths, copies them to the target location, and maintains a summary of copied files count. Progress updates are provided through JavaFX's Task mechanism, and results are stored in a list of view models.
