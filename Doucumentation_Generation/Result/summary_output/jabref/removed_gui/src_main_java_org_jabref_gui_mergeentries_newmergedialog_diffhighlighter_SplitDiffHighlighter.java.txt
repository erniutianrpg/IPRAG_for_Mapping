The `SplitDiffHighlighter` class highlights differences between source and target text in a split view. It compares the texts using a diff algorithm, then applies CSS styles to visualize changes: deletions in the source text (styled as "deletion") and additions/updates in the target text (styled as "addition" or "updated"). The highlighting is done by calculating token positions and lengths, then applying style classes to the corresponding text ranges in the UI components. If texts are identical, no highlighting occurs.
