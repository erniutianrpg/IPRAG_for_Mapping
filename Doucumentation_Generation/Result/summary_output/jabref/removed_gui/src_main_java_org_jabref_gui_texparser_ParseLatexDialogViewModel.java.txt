This JavaFX ViewModel class manages a dialog for parsing LaTeX files in JabRef. It allows users to:
1. Browse and select a directory containing LaTeX files
2. Recursively search for .tex files in the directory
3. Select files and parse them to resolve BibTeX citations
4. Display results in a custom dialog
The class handles file operations asynchronously, validates paths, and shows appropriate error messages. It maintains UI state through observable properties and coordinates between the view and backend parsing logic.
