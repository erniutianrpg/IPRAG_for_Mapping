This JavaFX `RadioButtonCell` class is a custom table cell renderer that displays a group of radio buttons for each enum value in a provided `EnumSet`. When a radio button is selected, it updates the table's data model with the corresponding enum value. The radio buttons are horizontally aligned in an `HBox`, with the currently selected item highlighted. This is typically used in table columns where users need to select one option from a predefined set of enum values.
