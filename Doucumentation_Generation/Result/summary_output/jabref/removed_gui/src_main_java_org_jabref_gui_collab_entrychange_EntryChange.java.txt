The `EntryChange` class represents a modification between an old and new `BibEntry` in a BibTeX database. It tracks changes, provides undo functionality via `NamedCompound`, and updates the database by replacing the old entry with the new one. The class also generates a human-readable change description (e.g., "Modified entry 'key'"). The `applyChange` method performs the update while recording undoable actions for reverting the change.
