The `ParseLatexAction` class is a GUI command that opens a custom dialog (`ParseLatexDialogView`) for parsing LaTeX files. It requires an active database (checked via `ActionHelper`) and uses the `StateManager` to access the current database context. When executed, it instantiates a `DialogService` and displays the parsing dialog. The action is only executable when a database is open.
