The `ChangeScanner` class detects changes between an in-memory BibTeX database and its corresponding file on disk. It loads the file using `OpenDatabase`, compares it with the current database via `DatabaseChangeList.compareAndGetChanges`, and returns a list of `DatabaseChange` objects representing the differences. If the file can't be parsed or no path exists, it returns an empty list. The class uses preferences and a resolver factory to handle the comparison and potential merge conflicts.
