This code defines a custom icon font enum `JabRefMaterialDesignIcon` that extends `Ikon` to provide additional icons not available in MaterialDesignIcons. Each enum constant represents an icon with a description and Unicode code point. The class includes methods to get an icon by description (`findByDescription`), and to retrieve an icon's description (`getDescription`) and code (`getCode`). These icons were created as SVG, converted to a TTF font, and are used in the JabRef application.
