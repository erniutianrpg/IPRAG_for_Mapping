The `FileDialogConfiguration` class configures file dialog settings for JavaFX's `FileChooser`, including initial directory, file name, and extension filters. It uses a builder pattern to set these options, such as adding file type filters, setting default extensions, and specifying initial paths. The class ensures valid directory paths and provides methods to retrieve and modify these settings. This simplifies the creation and customization of file dialogs in the JabRef application.
