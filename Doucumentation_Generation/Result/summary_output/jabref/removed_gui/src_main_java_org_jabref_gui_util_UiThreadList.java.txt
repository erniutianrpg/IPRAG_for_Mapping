The `UiThreadList` class ensures that list changes in a JavaFX `ObservableList` are processed on the JavaFX Application Thread (UI thread). If changes occur on a non-UI thread, it uses `Platform.runLater()` to schedule the change processing on the UI thread, blocking the current thread until completion. This maintains thread safety for UI updates. The class extends `TransformationList` and delegates all list operations (get, size, etc.) directly to the source list without transformation.
