The `FieldValueCell` class is a JavaFX component for displaying and interacting with field values in a three-way merge UI. It shows non-editable text in a scrollable area, supports selection via toggle behavior, and provides buttons for copying text and opening links (URLs/DOIs). The cell prevents text selection via mouse events and manages selection states through a view model. It's part of the JabRef application's merge entries dialog.
