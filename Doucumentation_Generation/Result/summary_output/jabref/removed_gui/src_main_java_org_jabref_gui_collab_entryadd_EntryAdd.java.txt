This code defines an `EntryAdd` class representing a database change where a new BibTeX entry is added. It extends `DatabaseChange` and handles the insertion of a `BibEntry` into a `BibDatabaseContext`. The change is named based on the entry's citation key and supports undo functionality via `UndoableInsertEntries`. The class provides a method to apply the change and another to retrieve the added entry. Essentially, it manages the addition of bibliography entries with undo support in a JabRef database. (98 words)
