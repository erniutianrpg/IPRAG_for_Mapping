The `SaveAllAction` class is a command in JabRef that saves all open library databases. When executed, it notifies the user, iterates through each open library tab, and attempts to save them using `SaveDatabaseAction`. If any save fails, it shows an error message. Finally, it notifies the user when all saves are complete. This action relies on JabRef's frame, dialog service, and preferences service for its operations.
