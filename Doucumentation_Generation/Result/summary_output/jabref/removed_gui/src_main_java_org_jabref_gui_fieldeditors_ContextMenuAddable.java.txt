The `ContextMenuAddable` interface defines a method `initContextMenu` that allows adding dynamic context menu items to a UI component. It uses a `Supplier` to lazily provide a list of `MenuItem` objects, ensuring they are only instantiated when needed (e.g., when the user opens the context menu), improving performance by avoiding unnecessary allocations. This is particularly useful for scenarios like scrolling through a table with open editors.
