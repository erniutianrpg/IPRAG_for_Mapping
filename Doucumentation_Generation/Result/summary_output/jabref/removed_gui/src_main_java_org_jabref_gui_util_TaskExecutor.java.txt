The `TaskExecutor` interface provides methods to execute and manage background tasks in JavaFX. It allows running tasks immediately (`execute`) or with a delay (`schedule`), returning `Future` objects to track task completion. It also supports task throttling via `DelayTaskThrottler` and includes a `shutdown` method for cleanup. The interface decouples task submission from execution details like threading and scheduling.
