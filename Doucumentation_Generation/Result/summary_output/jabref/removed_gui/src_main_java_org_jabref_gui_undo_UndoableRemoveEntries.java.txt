This code implements an undoable action for removing or cutting BibTeX entries from a JabRef database. The `UndoableRemoveEntries` class extends `AbstractUndoableJabRefEdit` to support undo/redo functionality. When entries are removed (or cut), they can be restored via `undo()` by reinserting them into the database, or permanently removed via `redo()`. The class also provides localized presentation names for the action (e.g., "remove entry" or "cut entries"). The `cut` flag distinguishes between removal and cut operations for display purposes.
