The `AuxParserResultViewModel` class processes and displays statistics from an AUX file parsing operation in JabRef. It takes an `AuxParserResult` object and generates a formatted string summarizing key metrics like entries found, resolved, unresolved, cross-referenced entries, and included strings. Optionally, it lists missing entries if requested and includes nested AUX file counts. The output is localized for multilingual support.
