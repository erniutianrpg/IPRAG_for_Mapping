This code provides functionality to fetch and merge bibliographic entries in JabRef. It supports fetching entries using identifiers (DOI, eprint, ISBN) via web fetchers, then merging the fetched data with an existing entry through a dialog interface. The merge process updates fields, handles undo operations, and notifies users of changes or errors. It also includes cleanup of imported data and error handling for fetch failures.
