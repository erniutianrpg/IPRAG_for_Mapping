The `BibField` class is a Java record that represents a bibliographic field with a priority. It implements `Comparable` to enable sorting by field name. Key functionalities include: case-insensitive equality check based on field name, hash code generation using field name, string representation of the field and its priority, and comparison of fields by name. The class encapsulates a `Field` and `FieldPriority` in an immutable structure.
