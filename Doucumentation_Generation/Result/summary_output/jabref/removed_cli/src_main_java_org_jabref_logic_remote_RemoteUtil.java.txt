The `RemoteUtil` class provides a static utility method `isUserPort` that checks if a given port number falls within the user port range (1024 to 65535). It returns `true` if the port is valid and `false` otherwise. The class has a private constructor to prevent instantiation, as it's meant to be used as a utility class.
