The `ArgumentProcessor` class handles command-line arguments for JabRef, a reference management software. It processes various commands including importing/exporting files, fetching entries from online sources, regenerating citation keys, setting file links, and managing preferences. The class parses arguments, performs corresponding operations (like database loading, searching, and metadata writing), and determines if the GUI should be launched. Key functionalities include file handling, preference management, and batch operations on bibliographic data. The class serves as the main CLI interface for JabRef's non-interactive features.
