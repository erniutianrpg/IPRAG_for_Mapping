The `DBMSConnectionProperties` class manages database connection properties for JabRef, including DBMS type, host, port, database name, credentials, SSL settings, and timezone. It initializes these properties from preferences (optionally decrypting passwords) and provides methods to access them, generate connection URLs, convert to `Properties`, and validate configurations. It also implements equality checks (excluding password comparison) and hash code generation.
