The `SaveAction` class is a GUI command wrapper for database save operations in JabRef. It supports three save methods: `SAVE`, `SAVE_AS`, and `SAVE_SELECTED`. Depending on the method, it either saves the current database, saves with a new name/location, or saves selected entries as plain text. The action's availability is bound to whether entries are selected or a database is open. It delegates the actual saving to `SaveDatabaseAction`.
