The `MainTable` class in JabRef is a JavaFX `TableView` that displays and manages BibTeX entries in a library. Key features include:

- Displays entries with sortable columns and supports multi-selection
- Handles drag-and-drop for files (importing/linking to entries)
- Implements copy/paste/cut operations for entries
- Provides keyboard navigation (jump-to-search, shortcuts)
- Supports right-click context menus and column header customization
- Manages entry selection and visual state persistence
- Integrates with JabRef's import system and database operations

The table serves as the central UI component for interacting with bibliography entries in JabRef's main interface.
