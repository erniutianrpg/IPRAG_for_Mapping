This code provides utility methods for managing bookmarks in LibreOffice/OpenOffice documents via UNO API. It offers functionality to: 1) access bookmarks by name, 2) retrieve a bookmark's text range, 3) create bookmarks (with automatic name adjustment if duplicates exist), and 4) remove existing bookmarks. The methods handle document and bookmark operations while managing exceptions like missing documents or disposed objects. The code interacts with LibreOffice's text document model through XTextDocument and related interfaces.
