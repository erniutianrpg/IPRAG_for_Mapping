This code provides a utility method `getTextContentByName` that retrieves a named element from an OpenOffice UNO (Universal Network Objects) container (`XNameAccess`). It attempts to cast the element to `XTextContent` and returns it as an `Optional`. If the element doesn't exist or the cast fails, it returns an empty `Optional`. Handles `NoSuchElementException` and `WrappedTargetException` for missing elements or access errors.
