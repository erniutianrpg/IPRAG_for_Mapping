This JavaFX component `SaveOrderConfigPanel` provides a UI for configuring export order preferences in JabRef. It offers three radio buttons for choosing between original, table, or custom sort order. When custom order is selected, users can add, remove, and reorder sort criteria (field + ascending/descending) in a grid. The panel binds to a ViewModel that manages the state and logic, including field selection and sort direction. The UI dynamically updates based on changes to the sort criteria list.
