This code defines keyboard bindings for a text editor (CodeArea) in a JavaFX application. It maps key events to editor actions like navigation (forward, backward, word jumps), text manipulation (delete, capitalize, lowercase, uppercase), and line/word deletion (kill operations). Each action moves the cursor or modifies text, then consumes the event to prevent default handling. The bindings are managed through a KeyBindingRepository.
