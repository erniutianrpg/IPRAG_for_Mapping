The `RemoteListenerServer` class implements a server that listens for remote messages on a specified port. It handles two types of messages: `PING` (responds with `PONG`) and `SEND_COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENTS` (forwards arguments to a message handler). The server runs in a loop until interrupted, manages socket connections with a timeout, and ensures proper cleanup by closing the server socket when done. It logs errors and warnings for connectivity issues or invalid messages.
