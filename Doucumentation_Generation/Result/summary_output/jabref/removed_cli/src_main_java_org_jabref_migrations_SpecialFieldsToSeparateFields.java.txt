This code migrates special field values from keywords to separate fields in BibTeX entries. It scans entries for specific keywords (like "prio1", "read", etc.) defined in a migration table, moves them to corresponding special fields (e.g., PRIORITY, READ_STATUS), and removes the original keywords. The migration is performed after opening a database, with keywords processed based on a configurable delimiter. The mapping between keywords and special fields is defined in `getMigrationTable()`.
