The `ArticleId` record in Java defines an immutable data structure with two fields: `idType` (a string representing the type of article ID) and `content` (a string containing the actual ID value). This concise record class is likely used to store and pass article identifier information, such as DOI or PMID, in a type-safe manner within a Medline-related importer. Records automatically provide `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` methods. (59 words)
