The `ConnectionLostEvent` class is a simple event notification in JabRef that signals when the connection to a shared database is lost. It holds a reference to the affected `BibDatabaseContext` (the database instance) and provides a getter method to access it. This event can be used to trigger handling logic when the database connection fails. (60 words)
