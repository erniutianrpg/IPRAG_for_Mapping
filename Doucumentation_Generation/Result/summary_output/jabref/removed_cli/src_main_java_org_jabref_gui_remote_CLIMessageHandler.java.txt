This code handles remote command-line arguments for JabRef, a reference management software. It processes the arguments using an `ArgumentProcessor` in remote mode, then adds the parsed results to JabRef's main GUI interface. The results are added to the JavaFX application thread using `Platform.runLater()`, with the first result focused by default. Errors during parsing are logged. The class implements `RemoteMessageHandler` to support remote communication functionality.
