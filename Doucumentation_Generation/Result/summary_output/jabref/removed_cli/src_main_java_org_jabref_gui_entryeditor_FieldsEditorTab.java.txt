The `FieldsEditorTab` class is an abstract tab implementation for JabRef's entry editor that displays and manages field editors for BibTeX entries. It handles the layout of fields in either a compressed (two-column) or regular (single-column) view, binds field editors to entry data, and includes a preview panel. The class also manages focus, field visibility, and style changes for the preview. It uses JavaFX components for the UI and supports undo operations.
