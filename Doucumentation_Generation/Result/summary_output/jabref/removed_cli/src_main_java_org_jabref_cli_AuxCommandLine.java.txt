The `AuxCommandLine` class processes an auxiliary (.aux) file to extract and generate a subset of a BibTeX database. It takes an auxiliary file path and a BibDatabase as input, uses an `AuxParser` to parse the file, and returns a new BibDatabase containing only the entries referenced in the .aux file. It also prints parsing statistics via `AuxParserResultViewModel`. The class ensures the .aux file has the correct extension before processing.
