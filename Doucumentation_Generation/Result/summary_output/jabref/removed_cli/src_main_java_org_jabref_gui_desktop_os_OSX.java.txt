This code provides macOS-specific implementations for file and system operations in the JabRef reference manager. It allows opening files with default or specified applications, opening folders and selecting files in Finder, launching Terminal at a specific path, and detecting application paths. It also returns default directories for applications and file choosers. The class uses macOS commands like `/usr/bin/open` for these operations.
