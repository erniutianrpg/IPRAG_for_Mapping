This code provides utility methods to access and manage styles (character and paragraph) in an OpenOffice/LibreOffice document via UNO API. It includes methods to:  
1. Retrieve styles by name from specified style families (character or paragraph).  
2. Get the internal names of styles.  
3. Handle exceptions for invalid style names or families.  
The main methods are `getParagraphStyle`, `getCharacterStyle`, and their internal name variants, all delegating to a core `getStyleFromFamily` method.
