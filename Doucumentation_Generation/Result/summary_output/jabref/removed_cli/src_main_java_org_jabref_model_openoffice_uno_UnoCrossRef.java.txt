This code provides functionality for working with cross-references in OpenOffice/LibreOffice documents. It has two main features: 

1. `refresh()` - Updates all text fields (including cross-references) in the document.
2. `insertReferenceToPageNumberOfReferenceMark()` - Inserts a clickable cross-reference that displays the page number of a specified reference mark. The reference is created as a "GetReference" text field with properties set to point to a reference mark and display its page number.

The code uses OpenOffice UNO API to interact with document elements and handle potential property-related exceptions.
