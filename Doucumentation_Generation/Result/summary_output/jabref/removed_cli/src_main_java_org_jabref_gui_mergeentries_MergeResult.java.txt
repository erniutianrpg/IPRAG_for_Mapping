The `MergeResult` class is a simple Java record that holds three `BibEntry` objects: `leftEntry`, `rightEntry`, and `mergedEntry`. It serves as a container for storing the original left and right entries along with their merged version in a merge operation. Records automatically provide constructors, getters, and other standard methods, making this a concise way to group these related entries.
