The `TreeCollector` class is a Java `Collector` that merges a list of nodes into a tree structure. It groups nodes with common parents as direct children, transforming a flat list into a hierarchical forest. The class uses functions to get children, add children, and check node equivalence. For example, it can convert `[A > A1, A > A2, B]` into `[A > {A1, A2}, B]`. It implements `Collector` methods (`supplier`, `accumulator`, `combiner`, `finisher`) to handle stream processing and tree merging while preserving node relationships.
