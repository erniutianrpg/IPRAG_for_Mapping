This code defines a custom annotation `@AllowedToUseAwt` in Java, which serves as a marker indicating that the annotated class is permitted to use AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit). The annotation includes a mandatory `value()` field to provide a rationale explaining why AWT usage is allowed for that particular class. This helps enforce architectural constraints while documenting exceptions.
