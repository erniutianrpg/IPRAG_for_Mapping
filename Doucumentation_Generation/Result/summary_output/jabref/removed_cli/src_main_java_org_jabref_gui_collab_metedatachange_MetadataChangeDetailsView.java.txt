This JavaFX class `MetadataChangeDetailsView` displays a summary of metadata changes in a JabRef database. It creates a vertical layout showing each modified metadata field (like library protection, groups tree, encoding, etc.) with localized labels. The view is anchored with padding and presents changes detected by `MetaDataDiff`. Each change type is mapped to a user-friendly string via the `getDifferenceString` method.
