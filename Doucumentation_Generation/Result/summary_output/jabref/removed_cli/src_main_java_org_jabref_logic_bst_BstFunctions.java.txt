This code implements a BibTeX style language (BST) interpreter in Java. It provides built-in functions for processing bibliographic data, including:

- Stack operations (push/pop/swap/duplicate)
- String manipulation (concatenation, case changing, substring)
- Math operations (comparisons, addition, subtraction)
- Name formatting and parsing
- Field validation (empty/missing checks)
- Output generation (writing to bibliography files)
- Control flow (if/while statements)

The class uses a stack-based virtual machine approach to evaluate BST programs, with functions that manipulate entries in a bibliography database according to the BST language specification. It handles common bibliography tasks like formatting names, adding periods, and purifying strings.
