This servlet (`/reset` endpoint) handles log reset functionality. When triggered via GET request, it: 
1. Stops the log file writer
2. Clears in-memory log storage 
3. Deletes all log files/folders with "kieker" prefix from Tomcat's logs directory
4. Restarts the log file writer. 

It includes helper methods to recursively delete folders and files, specifically targeting Kieker-related logs while preserving other log files.
