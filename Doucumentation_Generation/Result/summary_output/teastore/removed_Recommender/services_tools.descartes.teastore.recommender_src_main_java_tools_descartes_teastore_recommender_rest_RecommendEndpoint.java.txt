This code defines a REST endpoint (`/recommend`) that provides product recommendations. It accepts a user ID and a list of order items (cart contents), then returns a list of recommended product IDs (excluding items already in the cart) using a `RecommenderSelector` algorithm. The response is in JSON format, or an error if recommendation fails.
