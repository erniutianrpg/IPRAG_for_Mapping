The `SlopeOneRecommender` implements item-based collaborative filtering using the Slope One algorithm. It predicts user preferences by calculating weighted deviations between item pairs from historical user-item interactions. The class maintains two matrices: `differences` (average rating deviations between items) and `frequencies` (co-occurrence counts). During preprocessing, it builds these matrices from user purchase data. For recommendations, it predicts scores for items by combining known user ratings with the precomputed deviations, then returns filtered recommendations. Falls back if insufficient user data exists.
