The `ImageSize` class represents image dimensions with width and height. It includes constructors for initialization, getters/setters with validation (ensuring positive values), pixel count calculation, and string parsing/formatting using format "WxH". It also implements `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` for proper object comparison and string representation. The class can parse strings like "800x600" into `ImageSize` objects and vice versa.
