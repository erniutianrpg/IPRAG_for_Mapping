This code defines a `OperationExecutionWithParametersRecord` class that extends Kieker's `OperationExecutionRecord` to store execution monitoring data with additional parameter and return value information. It includes fields for parameter types/values, return type/value, and methods for serialization/deserialization, equality checks, and getters. The class is used for detailed performance monitoring in a TeaStore application, capturing method signatures, timings, and payload data.
