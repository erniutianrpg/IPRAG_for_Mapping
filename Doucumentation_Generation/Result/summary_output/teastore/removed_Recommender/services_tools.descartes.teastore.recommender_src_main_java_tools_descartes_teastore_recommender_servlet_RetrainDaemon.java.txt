The `RetrainDaemon` class is a daemon thread that periodically triggers a recommender system's retraining process. It sleeps for a specified interval (`looptime`), then waits for the persistence service to be available before executing a callback that retrieves new data and retrains the recommender model. This loop runs indefinitely until the thread is stopped. The class ensures the recommender stays updated with the latest data at regular intervals.
