This code implements a preprocessed Slope One recommender system for item-based collaborative filtering. It extends `SlopeOneRecommender` to optimize performance by precomputing and storing predicted user-item ratings during preprocessing. The class maintains a `predictedRatings` matrix mapping users to item scores, which is populated in `executePreprocessing()` by calling the parent class's recommendation logic upfront. This avoids repeated calculations during recommendations, improving runtime efficiency. The `getUserVector()` method simply retrieves precomputed ratings for a given user.
