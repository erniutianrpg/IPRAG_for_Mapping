The `LogConsumer` class is a Kieker filter plugin that processes monitoring records from RabbitMQ. It specifically handles `IMonitoringRecord` instances, printing CPU utilization details for `CPUUtilizationRecord` types and storing all records via `MemoryLogStorage`. It throws an exception for unknown record types. The class implements a single input port (`INPUT_PORT_NAME`) for receiving records and provides a basic configuration.
