This code defines an interface `IRecommender` for a product recommendation system. It has two main methods: `train()` to build a recommendation model using historical order data (order items and orders), and `recommendProducts()` to generate product suggestions for a given user and their current cart items. The interface ensures recommendations are only made after training and excludes items already in the cart.
