This abstract class provides a base implementation for product recommendation systems. It processes order data to create a user-product matrix tracking purchase frequencies (`userBuyingMatrix`) and organizes orders by user (`userItemSets`). The `train()` method preprocesses order data, while `recommendProducts()` generates recommendations (capped at 10 items) for a user based on their current cart items, excluding already purchased products. Subclasses must implement the core recommendation logic in `execute()`. The class handles data preparation and filtering, leaving the actual recommendation algorithm to be defined by concrete implementations.
