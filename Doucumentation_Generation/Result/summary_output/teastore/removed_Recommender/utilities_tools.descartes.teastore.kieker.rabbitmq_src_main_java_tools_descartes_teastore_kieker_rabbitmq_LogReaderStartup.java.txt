This code implements a ServletContextListener that initializes and manages two background daemons (LogReaderDaemon and FileWriterDaemon) using ScheduledExecutorService. During web application startup (contextInitialized), it starts both daemons with a 10-second delay. During shutdown (contextDestroyed), it gracefully terminates them. The daemons likely handle logging operations, with one reading logs and another writing them to files. The class uses basic Log4j configuration and provides static methods to control the file writer independently.
