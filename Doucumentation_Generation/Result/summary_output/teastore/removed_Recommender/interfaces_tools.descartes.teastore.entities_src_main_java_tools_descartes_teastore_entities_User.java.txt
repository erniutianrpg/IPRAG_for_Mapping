This code defines a `User` entity class for a pet supply store, representing user data with fields like ID, username, password hash, real name, and email. It includes constructors (default and copy), getter/setter methods for all fields, and overrides for `equals()` and `hashCode()` based on ID and username. The class is designed for REST API use and persistence, with comments noting that the ID setter is ignored by persistence.
