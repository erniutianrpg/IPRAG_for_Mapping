The `DummyRecommender` class is a placeholder recommendation algorithm that extends `AbstractRecommender`. Its `execute` method takes a user ID and a list of items, but simply returns a list containing `-1L` as a dummy recommendation, providing no actual functionality. This class is intended to be replaced with a proper recommendation algorithm later.
