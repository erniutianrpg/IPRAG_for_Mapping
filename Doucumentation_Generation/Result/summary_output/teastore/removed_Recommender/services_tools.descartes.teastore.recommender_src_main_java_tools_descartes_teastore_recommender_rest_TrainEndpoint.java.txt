This code provides REST endpoints for a recommendation system's training functionality. It includes three main methods:  
1. `train()` - Triggers (re)training of the recommender algorithm using order data, returning success/failure status.  
2. `getTimeStamp()` - Returns the last timestamp considered during training.  
3. `isReady()` - Checks if the recommender is ready to serve requests.  

All methods return HTTP responses, with the training process being computationally intensive and required before recommendations can be made.
