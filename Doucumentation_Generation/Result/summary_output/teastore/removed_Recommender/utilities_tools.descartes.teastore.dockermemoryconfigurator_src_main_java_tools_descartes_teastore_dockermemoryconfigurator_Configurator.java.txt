This Java program configures Tomcat's heap memory in a Docker container. It reads the total host memory from `/proc/meminfo` and the container's memory limit from `/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.limit_in_bytes`, then calculates the heap size as a percentage (default 80%) of the smaller value. The result is written to Tomcat's `setenv.sh` file as a JVM `-Xmx` parameter. The program ensures the heap doesn't exceed the container's memory limits.
