The `RecommenderSelector` class is a singleton that implements a strategy pattern for recommendation algorithms. It selects a recommender algorithm based on an environment variable, defaulting to `SlopeOneRecommender` if none is specified. It provides fallback to a `PopularityBasedRecommender` if the selected algorithm fails. The class offers methods to train the recommender with order data and generate product recommendations for users, handling exceptions gracefully by falling back to the popularity-based approach when needed.
