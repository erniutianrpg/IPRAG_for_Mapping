This code provides non-load-balanced CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for RESTful services. It includes methods to:
1. Create entities (returning new IDs)
2. Update entities by ID
3. Delete entities by ID
4. Retrieve single entities by ID or property
5. Retrieve lists of entities (with optional pagination and filtering)
The class handles HTTP responses, throws custom exceptions for timeouts/not-found errors, and includes logging for processing issues. All operations work directly with a service endpoint without load balancing.
