This code provides a client-side interface for getting product recommendations from a Recommender service in a load-balanced manner. The `getRecommendations` method sends a POST request with order items and user ID to the Recommender service endpoint, then returns a list of recommended product IDs. It handles errors (404, 408) and returns an empty list if the response fails or is null. The actual service call is load-balanced using `ServiceLoadBalancer`.
