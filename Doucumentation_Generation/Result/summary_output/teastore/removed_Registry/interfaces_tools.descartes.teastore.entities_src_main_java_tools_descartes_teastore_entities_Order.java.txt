The `Order` class is a Java entity representing an e-commerce order. It stores order details including ID, user ID, timestamp, total price, shipping address, and credit card information. The class provides getters/setters for all fields, a copy constructor, and overrides `equals()` and `hashCode()` based on ID and user ID. It's designed for use in a RESTful system, with persistence-ignored ID setting capability.
