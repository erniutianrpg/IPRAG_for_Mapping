The `LogConsumer` class is a Kieker filter plugin that processes monitoring records received via RabbitMQ. It specifically handles `IMonitoringRecord` instances, printing CPU utilization data and storing all records in `MemoryLogStorage`. If an unknown record type is received, it throws an `IllegalStateException`. The class implements basic configuration handling and has a single input port for receiving records.
