This code defines a simple HTTP servlet (`IndexServlet`) that serves as an index page for Kieker log management. When accessed via GET request, it returns an HTML page with three links: one to retrieve log files, another to display logs stored in memory, and a third to reset logs. The servlet is mapped to the "/index" URL path.
