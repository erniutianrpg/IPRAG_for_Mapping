This code defines a simple REST endpoint (`/ready/isready`) that checks if the service is ready. When accessed via a GET request, it always returns a JSON response with the value `true`, indicating the service is ready. The endpoint is part of an authentication service and uses Jakarta EE (formerly Java EE) annotations for configuration.
