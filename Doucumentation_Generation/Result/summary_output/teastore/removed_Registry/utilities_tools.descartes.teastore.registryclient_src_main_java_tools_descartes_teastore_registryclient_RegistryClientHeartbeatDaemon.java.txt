The `RegistryClientHeartbeatDaemon` class is a runnable daemon that sends heartbeat signals to a service registry. It takes a `Service` enum and `Server` location as parameters, then uses the `RegistryClient` to register the service with the registry once when executed. If registration fails, it throws a runtime exception. This helps maintain service availability awareness in the registry. (94 words)
