The `RESTClient` class is a generic REST client for interacting with services that provide CRUD functionalities. It configures HTTP/HTTPS connections with customizable timeouts, handles SSL/TLS for secure connections (including trust-all certificates for HTTPS), and provides methods to access REST endpoints. The client supports generic entity types (`<T>`) and includes utilities for building target URIs, managing connection settings, and processing lists of entities. Default timeouts are 600ms for connection and 6000ms for read operations.
