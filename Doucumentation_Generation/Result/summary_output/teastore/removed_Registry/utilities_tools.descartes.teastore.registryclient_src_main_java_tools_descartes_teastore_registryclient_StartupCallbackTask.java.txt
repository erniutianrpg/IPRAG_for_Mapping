The `StartupCallbackTask` class implements a `Runnable` that periodically checks if a requested microservice (via `RegistryClient`) is online. Once the service is detected (non-empty server list), it triggers a callback function. While waiting, it logs status messages (registry/service offline) and sleeps for 1-second intervals. This is used for service dependency management in a microservice architecture.
