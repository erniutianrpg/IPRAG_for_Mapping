This code implements a thread-safe service registry that tracks service instances and their locations. It provides functionality to:
1. Register/unregister service instances
2. Track service locations
3. Monitor instance health via heartbeats
4. Automatically remove dead instances (heartbeat cleanup)
The registry uses read-write locks for concurrent access and maintains two maps: one for service locations and another for heartbeat tracking. It follows the singleton pattern.
