The `HeartbeatInfo` class tracks service liveness using heartbeats. It records the timestamp of the last heartbeat (`lastHeartbeat`) and provides methods to update it (`newHeartbeat()`) and check if the service is alive (`isAlive()`). A service is considered alive if its last heartbeat was within the last 10 seconds (10000 ms). This simple mechanism helps monitor service availability in a registry system.
