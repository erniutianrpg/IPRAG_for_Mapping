The `FileWriterDaemon` class is a Runnable daemon that continuously writes monitoring records from memory to log files on disk every 5 seconds. It configures a Kieker FileWriter to store logs in `apache-tomcat-8.5.24/webapps/logs` with unlimited file size and entries. Records are fetched from `MemoryLogStorage` and cleared after each write. The daemon runs indefinitely until interrupted.
