This code provides a client-side interface for interacting with a TeaStore service through REST calls. It includes methods for user authentication (login, logout, checking login status), cart operations (adding/removing products, updating quantities), and placing orders. The operations use a load balancer to distribute requests across service instances and handle exceptions like timeouts or missing services. Each method takes a `SessionBlob` for session management and returns updated session data. The code encapsulates REST calls with proper parameter handling and response processing.
