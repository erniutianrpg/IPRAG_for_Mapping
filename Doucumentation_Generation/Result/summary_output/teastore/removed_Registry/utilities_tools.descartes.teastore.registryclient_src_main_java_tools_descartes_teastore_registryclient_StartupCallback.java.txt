The code defines a simple Java interface `StartupCallback` with a single method `callback()`. This interface serves as a contract for implementing startup callbacks, allowing classes to define specific actions that should be executed during system startup. The interface provides no implementation, requiring implementing classes to define their own callback behavior.
