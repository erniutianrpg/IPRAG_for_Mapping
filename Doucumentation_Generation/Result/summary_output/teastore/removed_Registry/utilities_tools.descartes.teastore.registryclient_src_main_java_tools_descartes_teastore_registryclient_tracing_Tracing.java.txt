This code provides utility functions for OpenTracing integration using Jaeger. It includes methods to:
1. Initialize a Jaeger tracer (`init()`)
2. Inject span context into HTTP requests (`inject()`)
3. Extract span context from HTTP requests (`extractCurrentSpan()` for both `HttpServletRequest` and `HttpHeaders`)
4. Helper methods to build spans from headers and create text map adapters for request builders

The code enables distributed tracing across microservices by propagating span contexts via HTTP headers.
