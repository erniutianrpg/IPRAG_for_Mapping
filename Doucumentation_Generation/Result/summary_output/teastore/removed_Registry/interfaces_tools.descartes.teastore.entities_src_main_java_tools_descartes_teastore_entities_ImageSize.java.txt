The `ImageSize` class represents image dimensions with width and height. It includes constructors for initialization, getters/setters with validation (ensuring positive values), pixel count calculation, and string parsing/formatting using an "x" divider (e.g., "800x600"). It also implements `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` for proper object comparison and string representation. The class ensures valid image sizes and provides utility methods for conversion between strings and `ImageSize` objects.
