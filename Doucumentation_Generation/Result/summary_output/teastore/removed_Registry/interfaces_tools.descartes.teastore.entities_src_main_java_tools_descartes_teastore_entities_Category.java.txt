The `Category` class is a simple entity representing a product category with an `id`, `name`, and `description`. It includes constructors (default and copy), getters/setters for all fields, and overrides `equals()` and `hashCode()` based on the `id` field. The class is designed for REST API use, with persistence-ignored ID setting. It follows standard entity conventions with proper encapsulation. (98 words)
