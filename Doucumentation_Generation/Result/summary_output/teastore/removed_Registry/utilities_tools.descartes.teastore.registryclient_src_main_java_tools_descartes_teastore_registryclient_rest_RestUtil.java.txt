The `RestUtil` class provides utility methods for handling REST responses. It includes methods to:  
1. Throw common exceptions (404 Not Found, 408 Timeout) from responses.  
2. Read entities from responses (returning null or the entity).  
3. Read and process entities while handling exceptions and closing responses.  
4. Specialized methods for handling lists of `Order` and `Product` entities, returning empty lists if responses are invalid.  

The class serves as a helper for REST client operations, centralizing response handling logic. (98 words)
