The `TrackingFilter` is a servlet filter that implements request tracking using Kieker monitoring. It extracts or generates tracing information (trace ID, session ID, execution order/stack indexes) from HTTP headers, stores them thread-locally, and propagates them in responses. It skips tracking for "webui" URLs and handles both new requests (generating new IDs) and traced requests (parsing existing IDs). The filter ensures monitoring context is passed through the request chain and cleans up thread-local data afterward. It integrates with OpenTracing for distributed tracing.
