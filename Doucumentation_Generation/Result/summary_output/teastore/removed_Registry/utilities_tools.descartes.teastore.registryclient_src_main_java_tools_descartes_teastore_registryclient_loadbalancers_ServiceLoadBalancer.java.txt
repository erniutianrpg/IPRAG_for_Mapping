This code implements a client-side load balancer for REST services using Netflix's Ribbon library. It maintains a pool of service instances (servers) for each service, balances requests across them, and handles retries on failures. Key features include:

1. Dynamic server list updates from a service registry
2. Load balancing REST operations across available servers
3. Multicast operations to all service instances
4. Thread-safe operations using read-write locks
5. Handling of timeouts and not-found responses
6. Caching of REST clients for endpoints

The balancer supports both single requests (with failover) and multicast operations while managing server lists and client connections efficiently.
