This code is an abstract AspectJ aspect for monitoring method executions with Kieker, a monitoring framework. It tracks operation execution times and optionally logs parameter values and return values based on an environment variable (`LOG_PARAMETERS`). The aspect handles trace IDs, execution order, and call depth, and can process collections, session blobs, and image sizes specially. If parameter logging is disabled, it falls back to basic operation execution logging. The actual pointcut to monitor is left for subclasses to define.
