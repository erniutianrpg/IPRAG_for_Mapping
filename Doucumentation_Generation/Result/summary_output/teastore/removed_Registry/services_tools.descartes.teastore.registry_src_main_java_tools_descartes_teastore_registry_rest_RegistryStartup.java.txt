This code implements a `ServletContextListener` that initializes and manages a registry service's heartbeat mechanism. On startup, it schedules a periodic task (every 2500ms) to clean up stale entries via `heartBeatCleanup()`. On shutdown, it terminates the scheduler. The registry ensures service availability by regularly checking registered services.
