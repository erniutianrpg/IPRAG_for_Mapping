The `ServiceLoadBalancerResult` class is a wrapper for results from service load balancer calls. It stores a status code and an entity of generic type `R`. The static method `fromRESTOperation` executes a REST operation using a provided client and function, then returns a result containing either the operation's output entity or an error status code (404 or 408) if exceptions occur. The class provides getters for the status code and entity, with private setters used internally.
