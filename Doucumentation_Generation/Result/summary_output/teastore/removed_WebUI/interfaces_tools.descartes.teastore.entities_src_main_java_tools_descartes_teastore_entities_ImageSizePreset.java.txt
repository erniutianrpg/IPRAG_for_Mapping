This code defines an `ImageSizePreset` enum that represents predefined image dimensions for different use cases in an e-commerce system (e.g., icons, portraits, logos). Each enum constant is associated with an `ImageSize` object specifying width and height. The class also provides a standard image size (`STD_IMAGE_SIZE`) set to `FULL` (300x300) and includes a method to retrieve the dimensions for each preset. This helps maintain consistent image sizing across the application.
