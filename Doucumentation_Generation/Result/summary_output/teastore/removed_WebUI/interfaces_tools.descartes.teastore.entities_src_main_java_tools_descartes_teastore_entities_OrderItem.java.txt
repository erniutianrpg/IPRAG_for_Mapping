The `OrderItem` class represents an item in a shopping cart or order, containing a product ID, order ID, quantity, and unit price. It includes standard getters/setters for these fields, a copy constructor, and overrides for `equals()` and `hashCode()` based on ID, order ID, and product ID. This entity class is designed for use in an e-commerce system to track items within orders.
