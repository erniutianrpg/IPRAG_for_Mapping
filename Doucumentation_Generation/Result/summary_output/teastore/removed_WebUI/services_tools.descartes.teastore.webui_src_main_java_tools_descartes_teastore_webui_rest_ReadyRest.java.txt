This code implements a simple REST endpoint (`/ready/isready`) that checks if a service is ready. It returns a JSON response with `true` when accessed via a GET request, indicating the service is always ready. The endpoint is part of a store cart system and uses Jakarta EE (formerly Java EE) annotations for RESTful web services.
