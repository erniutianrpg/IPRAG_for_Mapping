The `CartServlet` handles GET requests for a shopping cart web view. It retrieves the user's session, fetches cart items and associated product details from backend services, and prepares data for display including: cart contents, product images, categories, login status, and recommended products (limited to 3 ads). Finally, it forwards the request to a JSP page for rendering the cart interface. The servlet uses load-balanced REST calls to various microservices (persistence, image, recommender) to gather required data.
