This code is an abstract AspectJ probe that monitors method execution times and optionally logs parameter values using Kieker, a monitoring framework. It tracks execution flow, session IDs, and call hierarchies. When enabled via an environment variable (`LOG_PARAMETERS`), it captures method parameters, return values, and their types, converting them to strings with special handling for collections, `SessionBlob`, and `ImageSize` objects. Otherwise, it logs basic execution data. The probe manages trace identifiers and cleans up thread-local storage after execution.
