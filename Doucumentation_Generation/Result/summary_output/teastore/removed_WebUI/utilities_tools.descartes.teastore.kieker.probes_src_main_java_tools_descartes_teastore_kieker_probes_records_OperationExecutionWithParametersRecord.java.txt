This code defines an `OperationExecutionWithParametersRecord` class that extends Kieker's `OperationExecutionRecord` to store monitoring data of method executions, including parameters and return values. It adds fields for parameter types/values, return type/value, and provides serialization/deserialization methods. The class also implements equality checks and getters for all fields, enabling detailed performance monitoring and analysis in Kieker.
