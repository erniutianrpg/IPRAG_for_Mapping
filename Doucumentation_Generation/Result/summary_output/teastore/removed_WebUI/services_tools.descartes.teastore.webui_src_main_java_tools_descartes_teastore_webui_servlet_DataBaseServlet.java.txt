This servlet handles GET requests for the "/database" endpoint in a TeaStore web application. It checks for user cookies, retrieves a store icon image via load-balanced operations, sets the page title, and forwards the request to a JSP page ("database.jsp") for rendering the database view. The servlet extends abstract UI functionality and includes basic error handling.
