The `OrderServlet` handles order-related web requests for an e-commerce TeaStore. For GET requests, it checks if there are items in the cart (redirecting to home if empty) or forwards to POST. For POST requests, it fetches product categories, store icon, and login status, then displays the order page (`order.jsp`). It extends `AbstractUIServlet` for common UI functionality and uses load-balanced services for backend operations.
