The `LogConsumer` class is a Kieker filter plugin that processes monitoring records received via RabbitMQ. It specifically handles `IMonitoringRecord` instances, extracting and printing CPU utilization data from `CPUUtilizationRecord` types. All records are stored in `MemoryLogStorage`. The class includes an input port for receiving records and validates record types, throwing an exception for unknown types. Configuration handling is minimal, returning an empty configuration.
