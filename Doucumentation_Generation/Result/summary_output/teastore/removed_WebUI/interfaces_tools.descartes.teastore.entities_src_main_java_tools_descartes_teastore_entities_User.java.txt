This code defines a `User` entity class for a pet supply store, representing user data. It includes fields for ID, username, password hash, real name, and email, along with getters and setters for each. The class provides a copy constructor, and overrides `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods to compare users based on ID and username. The ID setter is noted as being for REST use only and ignored by persistence.
