The `LogReaderDaemon` class implements a RabbitMQ-based log reader daemon using Kieker's analysis framework. It connects to a local AMQP server (RabbitMQ) with predefined credentials, reads log messages from a queue named "kieker", and processes them using a `LogConsumer`. The daemon configures a `ChunkingAmqpReader` for message deserialization and handles interruptions gracefully by terminating the analysis controller. Essentially, it continuously monitors and consumes logging data from RabbitMQ for analysis.
