This code defines a `Product` entity class with attributes like ID, category ID, name, description, and price in cents. It includes getters and setters for all fields, a copy constructor, and overrides for `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods (based on ID and category ID). The class serves as a data model for product information, likely used in an e-commerce system, with REST API compatibility noted in the method comments.
