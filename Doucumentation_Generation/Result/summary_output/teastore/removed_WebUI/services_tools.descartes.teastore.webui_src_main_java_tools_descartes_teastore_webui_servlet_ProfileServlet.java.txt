The `ProfileServlet` is a Java servlet that handles GET requests for a user profile page in an e-commerce web application. It checks if the user is logged in (redirecting to home if not), then retrieves and displays user-specific data including profile details, order history, and store categories. It also loads the store icon and makes helper utilities available for the view. The servlet forwards the request to a JSP page for rendering.
