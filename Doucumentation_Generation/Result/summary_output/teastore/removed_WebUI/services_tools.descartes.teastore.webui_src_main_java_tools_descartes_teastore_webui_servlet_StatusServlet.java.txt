The `StatusServlet` is a Java servlet that displays the status of various services in a TeaStore application. It checks and shows the availability of services like WebUI, Authentication, Persistence, Image, and Recommender by querying the service registry. It also verifies if the database is created, if image generation is complete, and if the recommender has finished training. The servlet forwards this information to a JSP page for display, along with the store icon and title. If the service registry is unavailable, it handles the exception and indicates this in the response.
