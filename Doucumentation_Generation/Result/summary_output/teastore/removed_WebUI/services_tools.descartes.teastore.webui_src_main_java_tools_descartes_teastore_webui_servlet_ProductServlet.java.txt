The `ProductServlet` handles GET requests for product pages in an e-commerce web application. When a product ID is provided, it retrieves product details, related categories, and recommendations (limited to 3 items). It also checks user login status, manages session data, and fetches product images in specified sizes. The servlet then forwards this data to a JSP page for rendering. If no ID is provided, it redirects to the home page. The code uses load-balanced REST calls to various backend services.
