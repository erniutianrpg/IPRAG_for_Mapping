This code defines an abstract servlet (`AbstractUIServlet`) that serves as a base class for web UI servlets in a TeaStore application. Key functionalities include:

1. **Session Management**: Handles session blobs (serialized as cookies) for user sessions, including creation, saving, and destruction.
2. **Redirection & Cookies**: Provides methods for redirecting with optional cookie creation for messages (success/error) and product counts.
3. **Error Handling**: Manages exceptions (timeouts, not found, general errors) by displaying appropriate error pages.
4. **Request Handling**: Defines abstract methods for GET/POST requests to be implemented by child classes, with built-in exception handling.

The servlet centralizes common web UI operations like cookie management and error responses, reducing redundancy in child servlets.
