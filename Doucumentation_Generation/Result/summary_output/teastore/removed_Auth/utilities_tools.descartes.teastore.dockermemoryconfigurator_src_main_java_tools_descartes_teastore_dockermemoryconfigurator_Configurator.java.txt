This Java program configures the Tomcat heap space in a Docker container. It reads the host's total memory and the container's cgroup memory limit, then calculates the heap size as a percentage (default 80%) of the smaller value. The heap size is written to Tomcat's `setenv.sh` file as a JVM parameter (`-Xmx`). The tool ensures proper memory allocation within container constraints when Linux utilities might be unavailable.
