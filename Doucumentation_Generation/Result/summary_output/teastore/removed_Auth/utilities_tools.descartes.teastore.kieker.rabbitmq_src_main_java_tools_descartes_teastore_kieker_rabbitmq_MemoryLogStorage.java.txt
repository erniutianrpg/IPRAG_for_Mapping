The `MemoryLogStorage` class provides static methods to store, retrieve, and clear Kieker monitoring records in a thread-safe, in-memory queue (`ConcurrentLinkedQueue`). It acts as a temporary storage for logs, offering three key operations: adding records (`storeRecord`), retrieving all records (`getRecords`), and clearing the storage (`clearMemoryStorage`). The class is designed as a utility with a private constructor to prevent instantiation. (99 words)
