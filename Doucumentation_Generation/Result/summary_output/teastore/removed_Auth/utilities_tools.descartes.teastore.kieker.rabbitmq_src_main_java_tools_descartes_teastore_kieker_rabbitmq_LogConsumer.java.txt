The `LogConsumer` class is a Kieker filter plugin that processes monitoring records received via RabbitMQ. It specifically handles `IMonitoringRecord` instances, extracting and printing CPU utilization data from `CPUUtilizationRecord` objects. All records are stored in `MemoryLogStorage`. The class validates input types, throwing an exception for unknown record types. It implements a single input port (`INPUT_PORT_NAME`) for receiving records and provides a basic configuration.
