The `OrderItem` class represents an item in a shopping cart or order, storing its ID, associated product ID, order ID, quantity, and unit price in cents. It includes constructors (default and copy), getters/setters for all fields, and overrides `equals()` and `hashCode()` for proper entity comparison. The class ensures each order item has valid product and order IDs for persistence.
