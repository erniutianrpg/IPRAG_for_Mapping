The `FileWriterDaemon` class implements a background thread that continuously writes monitoring records from memory to log files on disk every 5 seconds. It configures a Kieker `FileWriter` to store logs in a specified directory (`apache-tomcat-8.5.24/webapps/logs`) with unlimited file size and entries. The daemon retrieves records from `MemoryLogStorage`, writes them to disk, clears the memory storage, and repeats until interrupted.
