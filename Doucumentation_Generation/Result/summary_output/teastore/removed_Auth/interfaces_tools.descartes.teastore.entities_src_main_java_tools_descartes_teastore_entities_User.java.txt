This code defines a `User` entity class for a pet supply store, representing user data with attributes like ID, username, password hash, real name, and email. It includes constructors (default and copy), getters/setters for all fields, and overrides `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods to compare users based on ID and username. The class is designed for REST API use and persistence, with notes that the ID setter is ignored by persistence.
