This code defines an `ImageSizePreset` enum that represents predefined image dimensions for different use cases in a web store (e.g., icons, portraits, logos). Each enum constant specifies width and height via an `ImageSize` object. The class also provides a standard size (`STD_IMAGE_SIZE`) set to `FULL` (300x300) and includes a method `getSize()` to retrieve dimensions for each preset. The presets cover various UI elements like thumbnails, recommendations, and error images.
