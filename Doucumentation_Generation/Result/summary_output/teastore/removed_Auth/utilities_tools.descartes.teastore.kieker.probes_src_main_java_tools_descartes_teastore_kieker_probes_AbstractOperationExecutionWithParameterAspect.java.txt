This code is a Kieker monitoring aspect that tracks method execution times and optionally logs parameter values. It uses AspectJ to intercept method calls (defined by subclasses via `monitoredOperation()` pointcut) and records execution details like timing, call hierarchy (EOI/ESS), and trace ID. When enabled via environment variable `LOG_PARAMETERS`, it also logs parameter values, return values, and collection sizes, with special handling for `SessionBlob` and `ImageSize` types. Otherwise, it only records basic execution data. The probe integrates with Kieker's monitoring framework for performance analysis.
