This code implements a simple REST endpoint (`/ready/isready`) that checks if the service is ready. When called via a GET request, it always returns a JSON response with the value `true`, indicating the service is available. The endpoint is part of an authentication service and follows standard JAX-RS annotations for routing and response handling.
