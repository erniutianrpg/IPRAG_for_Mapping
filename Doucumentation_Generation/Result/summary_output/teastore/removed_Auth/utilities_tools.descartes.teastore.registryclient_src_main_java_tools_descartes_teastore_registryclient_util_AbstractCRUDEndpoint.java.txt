This code defines an abstract RESTful CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoint for managing entities. It provides standard operations: creating entities (POST), retrieving by ID (GET), listing all with pagination (GET), updating (PUT), and deleting (DELETE). Each operation delegates to abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses for specific entity types. The endpoint handles JSON requests/responses and returns appropriate HTTP status codes (200 OK, 404 Not Found). It's designed to be extended for concrete entity types while maintaining consistent REST behavior.
