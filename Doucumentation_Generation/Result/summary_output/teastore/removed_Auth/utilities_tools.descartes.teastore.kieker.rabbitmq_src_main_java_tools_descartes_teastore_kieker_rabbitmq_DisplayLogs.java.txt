This code defines a servlet `DisplayLogs` that handles GET requests to "/displaylogs". When accessed, it retrieves all monitoring records stored in memory via `MemoryLogStorage.getRecords()` and writes each record as a string to the HTTP response. The servlet sets the response encoding to UTF-8 and uses a `PrintWriter` to output the logs. Essentially, it provides a web interface to view in-memory monitoring logs. (80 words)
