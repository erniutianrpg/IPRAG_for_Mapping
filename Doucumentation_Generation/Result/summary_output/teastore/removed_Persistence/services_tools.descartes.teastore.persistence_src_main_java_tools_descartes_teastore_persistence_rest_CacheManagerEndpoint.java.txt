This code provides REST endpoints for cache management in a Java application. It offers three operations: 1) Clearing the cache for a specific class by its fully qualified name (returns 200 if successful, 404 otherwise), 2) Clearing all caches (returns "cleared" on success), and 3) Resetting the Entity Manager Factory (EMF) (returns "clearedEMF" on success). All endpoints use DELETE requests and return plain text responses. The class utilizes a CacheManager for cache operations.
