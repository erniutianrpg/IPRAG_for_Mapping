The `CategoryRepository` class is a singleton that provides CRUD operations for `Category` entities in a database. It extends `AbstractPersistenceRepository` and implements methods to create, update, and manage `PersistenceCategory` entities using JPA's `EntityManager`. Key functionalities include creating new categories, updating existing ones by ID, and handling database transactions. The class ensures thread-safe access via a private constructor and a static `REPOSITORY` instance.
