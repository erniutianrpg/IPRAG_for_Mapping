The `CacheManager` class manages cache operations for a distributed persistence system. It provides methods to clear caches locally and remotely (via REST calls), either for specific entity classes or entirely. It also handles resetting Entity Manager Factories (EMFs) across services. The class uses a singleton pattern and multicast REST calls to ensure cache coherence across all service instances. Key functionalities include clearing local/remote caches and resetting EMFs.
