The `LogReaderDaemon` class implements a RabbitMQ log reader daemon that continuously retrieves and processes logs from a specified AMQP queue (`kieker`). It configures and initializes a Kieker analysis controller with an AMQP reader plugin to consume log messages, deserialize them using a binary deserializer, and forward them to a `LogConsumer` for processing. The daemon handles interruptions gracefully and ensures proper termination of resources.
