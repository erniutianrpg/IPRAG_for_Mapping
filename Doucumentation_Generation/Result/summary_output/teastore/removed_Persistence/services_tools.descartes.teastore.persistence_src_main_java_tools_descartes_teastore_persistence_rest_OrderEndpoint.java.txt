This code implements a RESTful CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoint for managing orders in a tea store application. It extends `AbstractCRUDEndpoint` to handle basic operations and adds a custom method `listAllForUser()` to fetch orders by user ID. The class interacts with `OrderRepository` for persistence and checks maintenance mode before create/delete operations. All methods return copies of orders rather than direct repository objects. The endpoint is accessible under the "/orders" path.
