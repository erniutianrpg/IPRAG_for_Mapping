This servlet (`/reset` endpoint) resets logging functionality by: 
1. Stopping the log writer
2. Clearing in-memory logs 
3. Deleting all Kieker log files from the Tomcat logs directory
4. Restarting the log writer. 
It includes helper methods to recursively delete folders/files with a specific prefix or entire directories. The reset ensures a clean logging state.
