The `SessionBlob` class is a data container that stores user session information for an e-commerce system. It includes user ID (`uid`), session ID (`sid`), authentication token (`token`), an `Order` object, a list of `OrderItem` objects, and a message string. The class provides getters and setters for all fields and initializes an empty `Order` upon construction. It serves as a central object to manage user session data during online transactions.
