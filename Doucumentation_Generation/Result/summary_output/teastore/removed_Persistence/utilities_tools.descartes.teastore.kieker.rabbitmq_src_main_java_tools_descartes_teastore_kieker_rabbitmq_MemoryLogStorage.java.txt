The `MemoryLogStorage` class provides static methods to store, retrieve, and clear Kieker monitoring records in a thread-safe, in-memory queue (`ConcurrentLinkedQueue`). It acts as a temporary storage for `IMonitoringRecord` objects, offering basic operations: `storeRecord()` to add records, `getRecords()` to retrieve the queue, and `clearMemoryStorage()` to empty it. The class is designed as a utility with a private constructor to prevent instantiation.
