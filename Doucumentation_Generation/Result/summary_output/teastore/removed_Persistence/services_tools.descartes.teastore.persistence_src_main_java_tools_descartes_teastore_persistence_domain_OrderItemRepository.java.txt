The `OrderItemRepository` class is a singleton repository that handles CRUD operations for `OrderItem` entities in a database using JPA. It extends `AbstractPersistenceRepository` and provides methods to create, update, and retrieve order items. Key functionalities include creating order items with associated products and orders, updating order item details, and querying order items by product ID or order ID with pagination support (start/limit parameters). All operations are transactional and ensure proper resource cleanup.
