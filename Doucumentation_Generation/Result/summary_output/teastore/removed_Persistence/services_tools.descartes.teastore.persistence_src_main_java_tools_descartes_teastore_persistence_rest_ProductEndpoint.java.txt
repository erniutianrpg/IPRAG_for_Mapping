This code implements a RESTful CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoint for product entities. It extends `AbstractCRUDEndpoint` to handle basic operations and adds two custom methods: `listAllForCategory` to retrieve products by category ID with pagination, and `countForCategory` to get the count of products in a category. All operations interact with a `ProductRepository` for persistence. Maintenance mode checks prevent modifications when enabled. The endpoint is accessible under the "/products" path.
