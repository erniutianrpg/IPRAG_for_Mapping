This code implements a ServletContextListener that starts and stops two background daemons (LogReaderDaemon and FileWriterDaemon) for a RabbitMQ logging system. On web app startup (`contextInitialized`), it schedules both daemons to run after 10 seconds. On shutdown (`contextDestroyed`), it properly terminates both executors. The FileWriterDaemon can also be stopped manually via `stopFileWriter()`. The code includes basic Log4j configuration and handles executor shutdown with a 10-second timeout.
