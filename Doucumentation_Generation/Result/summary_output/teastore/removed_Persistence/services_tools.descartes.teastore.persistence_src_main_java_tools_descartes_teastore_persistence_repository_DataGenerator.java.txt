The `DataGenerator` class generates and manages test data for a tea store database. It creates categories, products, users, and orders with random but consistent data (using a fixed random seed). It supports different database sizes (tiny/small) with configurable entity counts. The class also handles database maintenance mode (returning 503 status) and provides methods to check generation status, drop/recreate tables, and manage data generation flags. All passwords are set to "password" and data follows realistic patterns for an e-commerce system.
