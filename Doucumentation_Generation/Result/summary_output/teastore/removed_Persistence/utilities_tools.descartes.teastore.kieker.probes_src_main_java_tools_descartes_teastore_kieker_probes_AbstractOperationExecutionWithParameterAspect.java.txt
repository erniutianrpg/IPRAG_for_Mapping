This code is a Kieker monitoring aspect that tracks method execution times and optionally logs parameter values. It uses AspectJ to intercept method calls, records execution metadata (timing, call hierarchy, session info), and can log parameter values if enabled via an environment variable. For collections and specific types like `SessionBlob` and `ImageSize`, it logs sizes instead of full contents. The aspect differentiates between entry points and nested calls in the call hierarchy.
