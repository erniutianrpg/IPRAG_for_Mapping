This code defines a `HTML5ProcessLine` class that parses process information lines from BigBlueButton's HTML5 backend. It extracts the CPU usage percentage and instance ID from lines like "1.1 ... NODEJS_BACKEND_INSTANCE_ID=1". The constructor splits the input string to find these values, storing them in `percentageCPU` and `instanceId` fields. A `toString()` method formats these values for display. The class helps monitor Node.js backend processes in the BigBlueButton video conferencing system. (98 words)
