This Java interface `IReceivedOldMessageHandler` defines a single method `handleMessage` that takes an `IMessage` object as a parameter. It serves as a contract for classes to implement message handling functionality, specifically for processing received messages of type `IMessage` in the BigBlueButton API context. The interface doesn't provide implementation details, only the method signature.
