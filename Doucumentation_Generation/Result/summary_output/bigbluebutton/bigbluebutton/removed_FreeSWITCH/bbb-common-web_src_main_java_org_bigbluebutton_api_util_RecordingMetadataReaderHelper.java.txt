The `RecordingMetadataReaderHelper` class acts as a helper for managing recording metadata in the BigBlueButton API. It provides methods to validate text track tokens, retrieve/save recording text tracks, fetch recording metadata from XML files, and handle recording data conversions. The class delegates most operations to a `RecordingServiceGW` instance, serving as a bridge between the API and the underlying recording service. Key functionalities include metadata XML file handling, text track management, and recording data processing.
