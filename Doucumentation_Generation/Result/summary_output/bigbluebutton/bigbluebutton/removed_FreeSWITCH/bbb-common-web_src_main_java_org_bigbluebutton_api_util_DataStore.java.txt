The `DataStore` class is a singleton that manages database operations using Hibernate. It provides CRUD functionality for entities like `Recording`, `Metadata`, `PlaybackFormat`, etc. Key methods include `save()` for saving/updating entities, `find()`/`findAll()` for retrieval, specialized queries like `findRecordingByRecordId()`, and `delete()` for removal. It handles transactions with rollback on errors and includes a utility method `truncateTables()` to clear all recordings. The class initializes a Hibernate session factory with annotated entities upon instantiation.
