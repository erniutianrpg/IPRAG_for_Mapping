This code provides utility methods for file directory operations in the BigBlueButton presentation system. It contains two main methods: 

1. `deleteDirectory(File directory)`: Recursively deletes all files and subdirectories within a given directory before deleting the directory itself.

2. `deleteDirectoryFromFileHandlingErrors(File presentationFile)`: Safely deletes the parent directory of a given file, handling potential exceptions and logging errors if they occur.

Both methods work together to clean up presentation files and directories while ensuring proper error handling.
