This Java application handles importing and exporting recording metadata for BigBlueButton (a web conferencing system). It offers two modes: 
1. **Command-line mode**: Processes flags (-e for export, -i for import with persistence option, -s for single recording) and paths.
2. **Interactive mode**: Guides users through importing/exporting recordings via console prompts, with options for single/multiple operations and persistence settings. 

The app creates a default directory if none is specified and uses `RecordingImportHandler` and `RecordingExportHandler` to perform the actual operations. (99 words)
