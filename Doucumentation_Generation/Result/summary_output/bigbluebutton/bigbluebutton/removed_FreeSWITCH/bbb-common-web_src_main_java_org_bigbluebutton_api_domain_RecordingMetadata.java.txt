The `RecordingMetadata` class acts as a wrapper for `RecMeta` objects, providing getter and setter methods to manage recording metadata. It allows setting/getting the recording state, published status, and a map of metadata key-value pairs by delegating these operations to the underlying `RecMeta` instance. The class essentially serves as an interface to manipulate recording metadata properties. (98 words)
