This code provides utility methods for constructing JSON messages with headers and payloads. The `MessageBuilder` class defines constants for message components (version, name, header, etc.). It includes methods to generate timestamps, build message headers with metadata (name, version, timestamp, optional reply-to), and construct a complete JSON message by combining the header and payload using Google's Gson library. The output is a properly formatted JSON string.
