The `RecordingMetadataReaderHelper` class acts as a helper for managing recording metadata in BigBlueButton. It provides methods to validate text track tokens, retrieve/upload text tracks, fetch recording metadata from XML files, handle recording data (getRecordings2x), and save metadata. It delegates most operations to a `RecordingServiceGW` instance. Key functionalities include reading metadata from XML, managing captions/text tracks, and handling recording information.
