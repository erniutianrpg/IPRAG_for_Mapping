This code defines a Java class `Keys` that stores constant string values used as Redis key prefixes for a BigBlueButton conferencing system. The keys are for managing meetings (`meeting-`), active meetings list (`meetings`), meeting information (`meeting:info:`), breakout meetings (`meeting:breakout:`), and breakout rooms (`meeting:breakout:rooms:`). These constants help organize and access Redis data structures related to meetings and breakout rooms.
