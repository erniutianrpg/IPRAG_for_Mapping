The `PublishedRecordingMessage` class is a simple Java data structure representing a message about a published recording. It contains constants for the event type (`PUBLISHED_RECORDING_EVENT`) and version (`0.0.1`), and stores a `recordId` string passed via its constructor. This class appears to be part of a messaging system for handling recording publication events in a BigBlueButton (an open-source webinar system) API.
