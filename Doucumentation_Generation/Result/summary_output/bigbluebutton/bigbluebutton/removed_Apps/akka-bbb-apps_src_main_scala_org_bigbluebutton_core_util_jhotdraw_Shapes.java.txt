The `Shapes` class provides a utility method `outlineContains` that checks if a given point lies on the outline of a specified shape within a certain tolerance. It uses a `PathIterator` to analyze the shape's path segments (lines, cubic/quadratic curves) and checks for point proximity using geometric calculations. The method returns `true` if the point is found on any segment of the shape's outline. This is useful for hit-testing in graphical applications. The class is part of the JHotDraw library and is not meant to be instantiated (private constructor).
