The `UpdateRecordingStatus` class is a message object that communicates the recording status of a meeting. It contains two immutable fields: `meetingId` (identifies the meeting) and `recording` (boolean indicating if recording is on/off). This class implements the `IMessage` interface, suggesting it's used in a messaging system to update or notify about recording status changes. (49 words)
