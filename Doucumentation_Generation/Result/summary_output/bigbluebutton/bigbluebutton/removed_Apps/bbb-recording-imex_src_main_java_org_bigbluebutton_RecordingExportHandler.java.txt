The `RecordingExportHandler` class exports recording metadata to XML files. It provides methods to export all recordings or a specific recording by ID to a specified directory. For each recording, it creates a directory named with the recording ID, generates an XML file (`metadata.xml`) containing the recording's data (converted via `XmlService`), and formats the XML with proper indentation and encoding. The class uses a singleton pattern and logs each step, handling errors during the export process.
