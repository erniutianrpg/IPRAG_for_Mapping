This code implements a scheduled task in BigBlueButton that periodically purges inactive users from meetings. Using a `ScheduledExecutorService`, it runs a `CleanupTask` every 15 seconds (configurable) after an initial 60-second delay. The task delegates the actual user cleanup to a `MeetingService` instance via its `purgeUsers()` method. The scheduler can be started with `start()` and stopped with `stop()`. The interval between executions can be adjusted with `setRunEvery()`.
