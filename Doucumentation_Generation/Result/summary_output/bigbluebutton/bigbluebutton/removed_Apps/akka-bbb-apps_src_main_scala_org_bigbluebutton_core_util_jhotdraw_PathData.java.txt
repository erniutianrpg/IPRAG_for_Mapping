The `PathData` class stores path information for drawing operations. It holds three lists: `commands` (integers representing drawing commands), `coords` (doubles for coordinates), and `points` (floats for points). The constructor initializes `commands` and `coords`, while `points` remains uninitialized. This class appears to be a data structure for vector path data, likely used in graphics applications.
