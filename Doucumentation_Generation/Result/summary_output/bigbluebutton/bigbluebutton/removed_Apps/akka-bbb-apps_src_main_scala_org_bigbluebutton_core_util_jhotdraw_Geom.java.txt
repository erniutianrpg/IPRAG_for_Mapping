The `Geom` class provides geometric utility methods for 2D operations, including:

1. **Line-Point tests**: Check if a point lies on a line segment with tolerance.
2. **Direction calculations**: Determine relative direction between points (top/bottom/left/right).
3. **Rectangle operations**: Compute centers, edge points, containment checks, and grow/shrink rectangles.
4. **Intersections**: Find intersection points between line segments.
5. **Distance/Length**: Calculate distances between points and from points to lines.
6. **Angle conversions**: Convert between angles and points on rectangles/ovals.
7. **Range constraints**: Constrain values within min/max bounds.

The methods support both integer (`int`) and floating-point (`double`) coordinates via overloaded versions. The class is purely static with no instances allowed.
