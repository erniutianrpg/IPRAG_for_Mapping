The `GetChecksum` class validates and processes a checksum request in a BigBlueButton API. It extends a base `Checksum` class and ensures the query string is not empty. The constructor sanitizes the input and removes the checksum parameter from the query string for validation purposes. The class includes getter and setter methods for the query string. This is part of a checksum validation mechanism for API security. (98 words)
