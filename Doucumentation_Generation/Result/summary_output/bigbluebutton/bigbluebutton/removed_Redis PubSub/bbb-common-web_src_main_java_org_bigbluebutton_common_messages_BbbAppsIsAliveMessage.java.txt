This code defines a `BbbAppsIsAliveMessage` class for BigBlueButton, representing a heartbeat message to check if the apps are running. It includes timestamps for when the message was sent (`timestamp`) and when the apps started (`startedOn`). The class provides methods to convert the message to JSON (`toJson()`) and parse it from JSON (`fromJson()`), ensuring proper message structure validation. The message type is identified by the constant `BBB_APPS_IS_ALIVE`.
