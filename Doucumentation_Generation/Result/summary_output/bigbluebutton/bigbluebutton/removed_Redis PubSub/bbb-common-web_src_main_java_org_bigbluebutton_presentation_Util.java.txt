This code provides utility methods for file directory operations in the BigBlueButton presentation system. It contains two main functions:  

1. `deleteDirectory(File directory)`: Recursively deletes all files and subdirectories within a given directory before deleting the directory itself.  
2. `deleteDirectoryFromFileHandlingErrors(File presentationFile)`: Safely deletes a directory (and its contents) from a given file path, handling potential errors and logging them.  

Both methods ensure complete directory cleanup, with error handling in the second method.
