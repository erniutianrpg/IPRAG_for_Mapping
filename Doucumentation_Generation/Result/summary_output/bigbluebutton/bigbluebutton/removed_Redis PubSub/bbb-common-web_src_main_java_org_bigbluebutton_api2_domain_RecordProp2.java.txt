The `RecordProp2` class is a simple immutable data container that holds three boolean properties related to recording settings: `record` (whether recording is enabled), `autoStartRecording` (whether recording starts automatically), and `allowStartStopRecording` (whether manual start/stop of recording is allowed). The values are set once via the constructor and cannot be modified afterward.
