This code implements a scheduled task that periodically cleans up waiting guest users in the BigBlueButton conferencing system. Using a `ScheduledExecutorService`, it runs a `CleanupTask` every 15 seconds (configurable) after an initial 60-second delay. The task invokes `purgeWaitingGuestUsers()` on a `MeetingService` to remove inactive guests. The timer can be started, stopped, and its interval adjusted.
