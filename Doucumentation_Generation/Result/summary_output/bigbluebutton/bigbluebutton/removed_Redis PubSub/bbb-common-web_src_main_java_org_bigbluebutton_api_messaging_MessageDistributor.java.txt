The `MessageDistributor` class acts as a mediator between message handlers and listeners. It maintains a set of `MessageListener` instances and a `ReceivedMessageHandler`. When a message is received, `notifyListeners()` broadcasts it to all registered listeners by invoking their `handle()` method. The `setMessageHandler()` method also establishes a bidirectional relationship with the handler. Essentially, it facilitates message distribution from a single handler to multiple listeners.
