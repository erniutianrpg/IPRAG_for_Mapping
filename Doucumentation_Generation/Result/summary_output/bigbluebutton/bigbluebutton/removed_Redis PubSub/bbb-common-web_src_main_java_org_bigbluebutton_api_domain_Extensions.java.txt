The `Extensions` class is a simple Java POJO (Plain Old Java Object) that holds a `Preview` object. It uses Jackson XML annotations (`@JacksonXmlProperty` and `@JacksonXmlElementWrapper`) to control XML serialization/deserialization. The class provides getter and setter methods for accessing and modifying the `preview` field. Its purpose is to represent an XML structure where a `preview` element can be included without a wrapping element.
