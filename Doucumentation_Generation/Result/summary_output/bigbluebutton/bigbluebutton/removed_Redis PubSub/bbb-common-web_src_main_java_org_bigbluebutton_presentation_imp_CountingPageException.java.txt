This code defines a custom `CountingPageException` class that extends Java's `Exception`. It's used to handle errors during page counting operations, specifically when: 
1. There's an error counting pages (`PAGE_COUNT_EXCEPTION`), or 
2. When the page count exceeds a maximum allowed value (`PAGE_EXCEEDED_EXCEPTION`). 

The exception stores the maximum allowed pages, actual page count, and exception type, with getter methods to access these values. It's part of BigBlueButton's presentation system for handling document page-related errors.
