The code defines a custom annotation `@NotEmptyList` that can be applied to methods, fields, parameters, etc. It stores an array of `@NotEmpty` annotations and is retained at runtime. This annotation appears to be used for validating that a list or collection is not empty, building upon the `@NotEmpty` constraint. The annotation's targets include various Java elements where list validation might be needed.
