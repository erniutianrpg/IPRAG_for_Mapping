The code defines a `Breakout` class representing a breakout room in a meeting system. It stores three attributes: `parentMeetingId` (the main meeting ID), `sequence` (breakout room order), and `meetingId` (breakout room ID). The class includes getter and setter methods for each attribute and uses Jackson XML annotations to serialize these fields as XML attributes. This allows breakout room data to be easily converted to/from XML format.
