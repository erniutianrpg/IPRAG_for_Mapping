This code implements an image resizing functionality for the BigBlueButton presentation system. It uses the `convert` command (likely from ImageMagick) to resize an uploaded presentation file to a specified ratio. The resizing is performed asynchronously using NuProcess, with a timeout of 7 seconds. The success/failure of the conversion is tracked and returned. The class `ImageResizerImp` implements the `ImageResizer` interface, providing a concrete implementation for image resizing operations.
