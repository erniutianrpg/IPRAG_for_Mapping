This code defines a JPA entity class `Recording` representing a meeting recording in a database. It includes fields like ID, meeting/recording IDs, timestamps, state (enum with values like "published", "deleted"), metadata, playback format, and callback data. The class provides getters/setters, `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` methods, and manages relationships with `Metadata`, `PlaybackFormat`, and `CallbackData` entities. It maps to a "recordings" table and tracks recording lifecycle states.
