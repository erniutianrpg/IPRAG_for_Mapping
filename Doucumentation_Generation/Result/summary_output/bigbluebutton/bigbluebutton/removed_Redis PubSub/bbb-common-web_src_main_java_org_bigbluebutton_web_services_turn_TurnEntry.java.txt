The `TurnEntry` class is a simple data container that stores TURN server credentials and configuration. It holds four immutable fields: `username`, `url`, `password`, and `ttl` (time-to-live). The constructor initializes these values, and there are no setter methods, making the class effectively read-only after creation. This class appears to be used for managing TURN server authentication details in a WebRTC application.
