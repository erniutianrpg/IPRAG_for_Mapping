The `MessageBuilder` class constructs JSON messages with headers and payloads. It provides constants for message components (`VERSION`, `NAME`, etc.), generates timestamps in milliseconds, and builds message headers with name, version, timestamp, and optional reply-to fields. The `buildJson` method combines header and payload into a JSON string using Google's Gson library. Essentially, it facilitates creating structured messages for communication between components.
