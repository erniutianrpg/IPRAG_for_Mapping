This code parses process information lines for BigBlueButton's HTML5 backend instances. It extracts the instance ID and CPU usage percentage from a string input (typically from a `ps` command output). The constructor splits the input to find the CPU percentage and the instance identifier (marked by `NODEJS_BACKEND_INSTANCE_ID`). The `toString()` method formats these values for display. Essentially, it helps monitor individual HTML5 backend processes' CPU usage. (98 words)
