The `StunTurnService` class manages STUN and TURN servers for WebRTC communications. It provides methods to: 
- Retrieve STUN servers (`getStunServers`)
- Generate TURN server credentials for a user (`getStunAndTurnServersFor`)
- Get/set remote ICE candidates (`getRemoteIceCandidates`, `setRemoteIceCandidates`)
- Configure STUN/TURN servers (`setStunServers`, `setTurnServers`)

The service helps establish peer connections by providing necessary ICE server information and generating temporary TURN credentials for users. (98 words)
