This code implements a scheduled cleanup task for BigBlueButton meetings. It uses a `ScheduledExecutorService` to periodically call `purgeEnteredUsers()` on a `MeetingService` every 30 seconds (configurable). The task starts after an initial 60-second delay and can be stopped via the `stop()` method. Its purpose is to clean up user data for entered users in meetings at regular intervals.
