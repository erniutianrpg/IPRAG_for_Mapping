The `UpdateRecordingStatus` class is a message object that communicates whether a recording is active for a specific meeting. It contains two immutable fields: `meetingId` (identifying the meeting) and `recording` (a boolean indicating if recording is on/off). This class implements `IMessage`, suggesting it's used in a messaging system to update recording statuses. (50 words)
