This Java code checks PowerPoint files (.pptx) for three potential issues: 1) embedded EMF images (a vector format), 2) small background tile images (identified by specific checksums), and 3) whether all slides are hidden. It takes a file path as input, validates these conditions, and exits with status code 0 if valid, 2 if invalid, or 1 on errors. The checks use Apache POI to parse the presentation and Apache Commons Collections for filtering.
