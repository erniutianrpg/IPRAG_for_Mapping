The `UserRoleChanged` class is a message implementation that represents a user's role change in a meeting. It contains three immutable fields: `meetingId` (identifies the meeting), `userId` (identifies the user), and `role` (the new role). The constructor initializes these fields when creating the message. This class is likely used in a messaging system to notify about role changes. (60 words)
