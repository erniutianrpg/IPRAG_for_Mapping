The `RegisterUser` class is a message object that encapsulates user registration data for a meeting. It stores details like meeting ID, user identifiers, name, role, authentication tokens, avatar URL, and various status flags (guest status, authentication state, etc.). This immutable data structure is used to transfer user registration information between system components.
