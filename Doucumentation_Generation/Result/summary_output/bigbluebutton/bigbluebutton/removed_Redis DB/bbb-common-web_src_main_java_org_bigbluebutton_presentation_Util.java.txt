This code provides utility methods for directory deletion in the BigBlueButton presentation system. The `deleteDirectory` method recursively deletes all files and subdirectories within a given directory. The `deleteDirectoryFromFileHandlingErrors` method safely attempts to delete a presentation directory and its contents, handling any exceptions by logging errors. Both methods ensure complete directory removal, including nested files and folders.
