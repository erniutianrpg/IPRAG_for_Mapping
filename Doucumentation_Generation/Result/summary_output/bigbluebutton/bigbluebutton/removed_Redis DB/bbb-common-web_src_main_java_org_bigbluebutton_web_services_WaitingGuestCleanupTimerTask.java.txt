The code implements a scheduled task that periodically cleans up waiting guest users in the BigBlueButton conferencing system. Using a `ScheduledExecutorService`, it runs the `purgeWaitingGuestUsers()` method every 15 seconds (configurable) after an initial 60-second delay. The task starts via `start()` and can be stopped with `stop()`. This ensures efficient management of guest users waiting to join meetings.
