This code implements a callback URL service that processes meeting-ended events by making HTTP GET requests to specified callback URLs. It handles retries with increasing delays (30s, 1m, 2m, 5m) for failed attempts, logs success/failure analytics data in JSON format, and gives up after 5 attempts. The service uses a delay queue for message processing and asynchronous HTTP client for URL fetching, with separate threads for queue processing and task execution.
