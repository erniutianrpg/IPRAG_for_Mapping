The `Playback` class represents a recorded session playback in BigBlueButton. It stores metadata about the playback including format (e.g., "presentation"), URL, duration (length), file size, processing time, and a list of extensions. The class provides getter and setter methods for all these attributes, allowing access and modification of the playback data. This is essentially a data container class for managing playback information in the BigBlueButton API. (98 words)
