This code handles the import of recording metadata for BigBlueButton (a web conferencing system). The `RecordingImportHandler` class scans a specified directory for recordings, reads their metadata from XML files, converts them to `Recording` objects using an `XmlService`, and optionally persists them via a `DataStore`. It skips existing recordings if `persist` is true. The class follows a singleton pattern and logs operations using SLF4J.
