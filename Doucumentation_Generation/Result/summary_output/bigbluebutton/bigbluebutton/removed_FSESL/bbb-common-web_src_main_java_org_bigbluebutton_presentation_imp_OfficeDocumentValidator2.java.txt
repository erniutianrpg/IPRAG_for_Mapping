This code validates PowerPoint (PPTX) files for an uploaded presentation. It checks if the file extension is PPTX, then executes an external command (with a 20-second timeout) to validate the file. If validation succeeds, it returns `true`; if it fails or times out (after 25 seconds), it logs an error with meeting details and returns `false`. The path to the validation executable is configurable via `setPresCheckExec`. Non-PPTX files automatically pass validation.
