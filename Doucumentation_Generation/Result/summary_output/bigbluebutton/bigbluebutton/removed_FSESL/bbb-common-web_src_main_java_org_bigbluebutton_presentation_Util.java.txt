This code provides utility methods for file directory operations in the BigBlueButton presentation system. It contains two main methods:  

1. `deleteDirectory(File directory)`: Recursively deletes all files and subdirectories within a given directory before deleting the directory itself.  
2. `deleteDirectoryFromFileHandlingErrors(File presentationFile)`: Safely deletes a directory (and its contents) from a given file path while handling potential errors, logging failures.  

The code ensures clean directory removal and error handling for file operations. (99 words)
