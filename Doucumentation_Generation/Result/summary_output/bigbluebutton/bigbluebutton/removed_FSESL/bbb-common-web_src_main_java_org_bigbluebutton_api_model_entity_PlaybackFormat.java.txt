This code defines a JPA entity `PlaybackFormat` representing a recording playback format in a database. It includes fields like format type, URL, duration, processing time, and relationships with `Recording` (one-to-one) and `Thumbnail` (one-to-many) entities. The class provides standard getters/setters, methods to manage thumbnails, and overrides for `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` for proper object comparison and string representation. The entity maps to a `playback_formats` table in the database.
