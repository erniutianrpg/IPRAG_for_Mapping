The `IPresentationCompletionMessage` interface is a marker interface (an empty interface with no methods) in the BigBlueButton presentation system. It likely serves as a base type for messages indicating that a presentation processing task has been completed, allowing different implementation classes to be handled polymorphically. Marker interfaces are commonly used for tagging or grouping purposes in event/message systems.
