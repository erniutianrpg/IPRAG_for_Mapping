The `RecordingExportHandler` class exports recording metadata to XML files. It provides methods to export all recordings or a specific one by ID. For each recording, it creates a directory named after the recording ID, generates a `metadata.xml` file, and writes formatted XML data (with whitespace removed and proper indentation) containing the recording's details. The class uses a singleton pattern and relies on `DataStore` for recording data and `XmlService` for XML conversion. Errors are logged if the export fails.
