The `RecordingImportHandler` class manages the import of recordings from a specified directory. It checks for existing recordings, reads metadata from XML files, converts them to `Recording` objects using an `XmlService`, and optionally persists them via a `DataStore`. The class follows a singleton pattern and logs each step, including errors during file reading or parsing. Main methods are `importRecordings` (batch import) and `importRecording` (single file import).
