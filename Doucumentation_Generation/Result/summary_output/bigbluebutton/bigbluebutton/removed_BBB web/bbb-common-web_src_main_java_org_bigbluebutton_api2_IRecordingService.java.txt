The `IRecordingService` interface defines methods for managing recordings in a BigBlueButton system. It provides functionality to: retrieve recordings and their metadata (filterable by IDs, states, or metadata), check recording existence, publish/unpublish, delete, and update recordings. It also includes methods to reorder recordings and process individual recordings by meeting ID. The interface supports bulk operations on multiple recordings and metadata-based filtering.
