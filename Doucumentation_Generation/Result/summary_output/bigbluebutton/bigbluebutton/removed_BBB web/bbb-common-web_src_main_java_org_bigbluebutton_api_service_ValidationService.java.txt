The `ValidationService` class validates API requests for a BigBlueButton system. It handles different API calls (like create, join, end meetings) by sanitizing input parameters, initializing appropriate request objects, and performing validation checks (including checksum verification). The service uses Java Bean Validation to check constraints and returns any violations. It also supports parameter encoding and query string construction. Key features include request type handling (GET/POST), parameter sanitization, and checksum validation for security.
