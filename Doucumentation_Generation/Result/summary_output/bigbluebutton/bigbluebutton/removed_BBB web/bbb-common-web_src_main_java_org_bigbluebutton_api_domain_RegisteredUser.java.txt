The `RegisteredUser` class represents a user in a system (likely BigBlueButton), storing their authentication token, user ID, registration time, and guest-related statuses. It tracks whether the user is excluded from dashboards, their guest status (e.g., waiting/approved), lobby exit status, and wait timestamps. The class provides getters/setters for these properties and automatically records timestamps upon creation and updates.
