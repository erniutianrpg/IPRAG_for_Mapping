The `GetChecksum` class validates and processes a query string by ensuring it's not empty and sanitizing it. It extends a `Checksum` class, removing the checksum parameter from the query string for validation purposes. The class includes constraints for checksum validation and provides getter/setter methods for the query string. Key operations include input sanitization and checksum removal from the query string.
