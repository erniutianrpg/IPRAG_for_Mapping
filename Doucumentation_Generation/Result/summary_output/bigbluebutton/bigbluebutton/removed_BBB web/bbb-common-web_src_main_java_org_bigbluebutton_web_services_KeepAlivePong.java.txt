The `KeepAlivePong` class is a simple Java data structure that implements `KeepAliveMessage`. It stores and provides read-only access to three fields: `system` (a String), and two timestamps (`bbbWebTimestamp` and `akkaAppsTimestamp` as Long values). It acts as a response message (pong) in a keep-alive mechanism, carrying system identification and timing information between components. The data is set once via the constructor and cannot be modified afterward.
