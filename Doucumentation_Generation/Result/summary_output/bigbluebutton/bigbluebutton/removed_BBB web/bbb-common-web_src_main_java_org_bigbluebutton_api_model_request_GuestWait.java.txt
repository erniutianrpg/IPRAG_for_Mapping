This code defines a `GuestWait` request class for a BigBlueButton API. It handles guest waiting functionality by validating a user session token (`sessionToken`) and meeting ID (`meetingID`) constraints. The class populates these fields from request parameters, using `SessionService` to manage the session token and retrieve the associated meeting ID. Key validations include checking if the meeting exists and hasn't ended, and if the user session is valid. The class implements the `Request` interface for parameter handling. (98 words)
