This Java code defines an `EndMeeting` class for handling requests to end a BigBlueButton meeting. It validates parameters like `meetingID` and `password` using constraints, ensures the meeting exists, and checks password validity. The class extends `RequestWithChecksum` for security verification and includes methods to set/get meeting details and populate parameters from a map. It specifically requires a moderator password to authorize the meeting termination.
