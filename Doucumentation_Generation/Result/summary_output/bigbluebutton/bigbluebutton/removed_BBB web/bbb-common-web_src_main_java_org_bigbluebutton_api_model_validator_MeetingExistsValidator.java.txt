This code is a validator that checks if a meeting with a given ID exists. It implements `ConstraintValidator` for the `MeetingExistsConstraint` annotation. The `isValid` method takes a meeting ID, verifies it's not null, and checks if a corresponding meeting exists using `ServiceUtils.findMeetingFromMeetingID()`. If the meeting doesn't exist or the ID is null, it returns false; otherwise, it returns true. Logs are used to track validation attempts and errors.
