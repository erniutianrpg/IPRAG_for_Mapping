The `SizeValidator` class implements a custom constraint validator for strings. It checks if a string's length falls within a specified minimum (`min`) and maximum (`max`) range defined in the `@Size` annotation. If the string is null, it's considered valid. Otherwise, it returns true only if the string length is between the min and max values (inclusive). This is typically used for input validation in Java applications.
