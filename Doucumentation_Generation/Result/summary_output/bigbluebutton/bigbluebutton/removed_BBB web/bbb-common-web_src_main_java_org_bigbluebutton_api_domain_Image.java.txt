The code defines an `Image` class representing an image element in XML format. It includes attributes for `width`, `height`, and `alt` text (annotated as XML attributes), and a `value` field (annotated as XML text content) for the image URL. The class provides getter and setter methods for all fields, enabling serialization/deserialization of image data to/from XML using Jackson annotations.
