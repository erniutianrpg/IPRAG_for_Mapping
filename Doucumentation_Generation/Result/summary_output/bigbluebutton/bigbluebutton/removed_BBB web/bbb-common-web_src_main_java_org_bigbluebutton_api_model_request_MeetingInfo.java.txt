The code defines a `MeetingInfo` class for handling meeting information requests in a BigBlueButton API. It extends `RequestWithChecksum` and includes parameters validation, specifically ensuring the meeting ID exists and is valid. The class contains a meetingID field with constraints, getter/setter methods, and overrides `populateFromParamsMap` to extract the meeting ID from request parameters. Essentially, it's a request model for fetching meeting details with proper validation and parameter handling. (98 words)
