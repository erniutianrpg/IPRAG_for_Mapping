The `DurationProp2` class is a simple data container that stores timing-related properties: a duration (as an Integer) and three timestamps (createdTime, startTime, endTime) as long values. It provides a constructor to initialize these immutable fields, which can then be accessed directly since they're public. The class serves as a basic structure to hold duration and time information for meetings or events. (72 words)
