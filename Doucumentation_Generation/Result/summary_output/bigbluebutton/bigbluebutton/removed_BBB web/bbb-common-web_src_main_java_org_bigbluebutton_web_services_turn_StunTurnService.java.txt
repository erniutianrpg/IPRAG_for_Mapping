The `StunTurnService` class manages STUN and TURN servers for WebRTC connections. It provides methods to: 
1. Retrieve STUN servers (`getStunServers`)
2. Generate TURN server credentials for a user (`getStunAndTurnServersFor`) 
3. Get/set remote ICE candidates and server configurations. 

The service maintains sets of STUN servers, TURN servers, and remote ICE candidates, facilitating WebRTC's NAT traversal and connectivity.
