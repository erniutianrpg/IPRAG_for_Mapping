The `UserLeftVoice` class is a message implementation that signals when a user leaves a voice channel in a meeting. It contains two fields: `meetingId` (identifies the meeting) and `userId` (identifies the user who left). The constructor initializes these fields. This class serves as a data structure for communicating user departure events in a messaging system. (58 words)
