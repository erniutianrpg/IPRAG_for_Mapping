The code defines a custom annotation `@NotEmptyList` that can be applied to methods, fields, parameters, etc. This annotation holds an array of `@NotEmpty` annotations, allowing multiple `@NotEmpty` constraints to be grouped together. The annotation is retained at runtime (`@Retention(RUNTIME)`) for processing during program execution. Essentially, it provides a way to apply multiple non-empty validation constraints in a single annotation.
