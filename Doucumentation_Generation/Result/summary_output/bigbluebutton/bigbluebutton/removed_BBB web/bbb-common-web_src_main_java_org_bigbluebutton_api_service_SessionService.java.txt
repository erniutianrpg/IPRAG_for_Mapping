The `SessionService` class manages user sessions in a meeting system. It stores a session token and associated `UserSession`, retrieved via `MeetingService`. Key functionalities include: setting/getting the session token, fetching the user session using the token, and retrieving the meeting ID from the user session. The class interacts with `MeetingService` to authenticate and access session data. If no user session exists, it returns an empty string for the meeting ID. (98 words)
