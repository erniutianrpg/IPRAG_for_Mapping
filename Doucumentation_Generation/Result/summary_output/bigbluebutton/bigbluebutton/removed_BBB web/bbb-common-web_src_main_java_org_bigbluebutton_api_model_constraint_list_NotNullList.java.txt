The code defines a custom annotation `@NotNullList` that can be applied to various Java elements (methods, fields, etc.). This annotation holds an array of `@NotNull` annotations, allowing multiple `@NotNull` constraints to be grouped together. The annotation is retained at runtime and can be used for validation purposes. Essentially, it's a container for multiple `@NotNull` constraints that can be applied collectively.
