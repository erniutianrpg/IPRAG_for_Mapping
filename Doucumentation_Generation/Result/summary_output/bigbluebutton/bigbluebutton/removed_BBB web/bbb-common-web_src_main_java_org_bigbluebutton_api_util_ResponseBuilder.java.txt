The `ResponseBuilder` class generates XML responses for BigBlueButton API requests using FreeMarker templates. It constructs responses for various operations like meeting creation, joining meetings, getting meeting info, checking meeting status, handling errors, and managing recordings. The class uses template processing to populate dynamic data (like meeting details, timestamps, error messages) into predefined XML structures. It supports different response formats based on the API endpoint called, ensuring consistent and properly formatted output for client applications.
