This code defines a custom Java annotation `@MeetingExistsConstraint` for validation. It checks if a meeting with a given ID exists using the `MeetingExistsValidator` class. The annotation can be applied to fields (`FIELD` target) and is retained at runtime (`RUNTIME`). It includes default error messages and supports validation groups and payloads as per JSR-380 (Bean Validation 2.0). The key "notFound" and message indicate the meeting ID was not found.
