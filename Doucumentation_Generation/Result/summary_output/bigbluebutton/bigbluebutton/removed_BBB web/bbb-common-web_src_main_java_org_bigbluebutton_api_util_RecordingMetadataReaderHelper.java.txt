The `RecordingMetadataReaderHelper` class acts as a helper for managing recording metadata in BigBlueButton. It provides methods to validate text track tokens, retrieve and store text tracks, fetch recordings in a 2x format, read and save recording metadata from/to XML files, and get metadata file locations. It delegates most operations to a `RecordingServiceGW` instance. Essentially, it serves as an intermediary layer for recording-related operations, handling metadata and text tracks for recordings.
