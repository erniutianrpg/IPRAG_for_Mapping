The `GuestsStatus` class is a simple data container that represents a user's guest status in a messaging system. It stores two immutable fields: `userId` (identifying the user) and `status` (representing the user's guest status). The class provides a constructor to initialize these values but no other functionality. It's likely used to pass guest status information between system components. (58 words)
