The `PublishedRecordingMessage` class defines a simple message structure for a published recording event in a BigBlueButton system. It contains constants for the event name (`PUBLISHED_RECORDING_EVENT`) and version (`VERSION`), and stores a recording ID (`recordId`) which is set via the constructor. This class appears to be used for messaging when a recording is published. (60 words)
