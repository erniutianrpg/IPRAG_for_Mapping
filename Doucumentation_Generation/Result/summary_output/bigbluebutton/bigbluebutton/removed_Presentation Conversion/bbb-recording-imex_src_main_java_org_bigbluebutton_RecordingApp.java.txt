This Java application handles importing and exporting recording metadata for BigBlueButton. It offers two modes: command-line (with flags for export/import, persistence, and recording ID) and interactive (menu-driven). The command mode processes arguments to determine whether to import/export single or multiple recordings, while the interactive mode guides users through prompts. Default paths are created if none are specified. The actual import/export operations are delegated to `RecordingImportHandler` and `RecordingExportHandler` classes.
