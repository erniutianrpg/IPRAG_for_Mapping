This Java class `RecordingMetadataPlayback` represents playback metadata for a recording in XML format using Jackson annotations. It stores playback information including format, link, processing time, duration (with a method to convert to minutes), extensions, and size. The class provides getter and setter methods for all fields, with XML property mappings for serialization/deserialization. The `calculateDuration()` method converts milliseconds to minutes.
