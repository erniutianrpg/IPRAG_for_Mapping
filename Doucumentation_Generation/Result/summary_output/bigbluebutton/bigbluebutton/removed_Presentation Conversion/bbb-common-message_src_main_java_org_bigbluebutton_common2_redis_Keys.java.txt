This code defines a Java class `Keys` that stores constant string values used as Redis key prefixes for a BigBlueButton conferencing system. The keys are used to identify meetings (`MEETING`), meeting collections (`MEETINGS`), meeting info (`MEETING_INFO`), breakout meetings (`BREAKOUT_MEETING`), and breakout rooms (`BREAKOUT_ROOMS`) in Redis. These constants help organize and access meeting-related data in the Redis database.
