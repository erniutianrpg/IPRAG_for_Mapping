This code defines a `RecordingServiceGW` interface for handling recording-related operations in a BigBlueButton system. It provides methods to: retrieve recordings in a specific format (`getRecordings2x`), fetch/save recording metadata from/to XML files (`getRecordingMetadata`, `saveRecordingMetadata`), validate text track tokens (`validateTextTrackSingleUseToken`), manage text tracks for recordings (`getRecordingTextTracks`, `putRecordingTextTrack`). The interface supports both Scala (`Option`) and Java types, focusing on recording metadata management and text track operations.
