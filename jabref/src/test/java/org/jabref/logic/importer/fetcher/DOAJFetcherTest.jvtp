         withfield standardfield objective  based on magnetic resonance imaging  mri   verify the structural and functional changes related to memory deficits in non-demented elderly individuals in comparison with young adults  methodology  proceeded a systematic review based on preferred reporting items systematic review and meta-analysis  prisma  fluxogram  the search was done on pubmed  scopus and ebsco databases using jabref 2 10  and web of science  it was included in the analysis quasi-experimental  cross-sectional  cohort and control studies published between 2005 and 2014 in national and international indexed periodicals that had as sample  non-demented individuals older than 60 years old  who were submitted to mri investigation of their any brain structural and functional changes associated with memory deficits  identified in neuropsychologicals tests  results  about the imaging technique  we reviewed studies that used structural mris  two articles   functional mris  six articles   both techniques  four articles   in the 12 studies  38 distinct neuropsychological tests were used  an average of five different tests each study  variation of 1-12   the most used tests were wais digit span backwards  seven articles   trail making test a and b  four articles  and wechsler memory scale  four articles   conclusion  the review showed that in normal aging the parahippocampal white substance  the hippocampus volume and entorhinal cortex slightly shrink  causing verbal memory reduction  possibly due to fiber demyelination  reduced connections between temporal and frontal lobes contributing to an impairement of episodic  working memory and verbal fluency  reduction suppression of irrelevant information  affecting the register of information  changes on frontal and parietal areas  compromising recognition memory  modifications in activity and connectivity of the mode network  reorganization of cognitive functions and also a slower response  probably due to reduction of pre-frontal cortex activation
