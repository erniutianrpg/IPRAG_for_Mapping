		"Manages the business logic of TEAMMATES, including handling relationships between entities, managing transactions, input value sanitization, access control rights, and interfacing with GAE-provided or third-party APIs."
		"Performs CRUD operations on data entities, validation of data, and abstraction of GQL queries, hiding the complexities of datastore from the Logic component."
		"Contains utility classes, custom exceptions, and data transfer objects used across the entire application for easy consolidation and transfer of structured data."
		"Handles end-to-end testing and load & performance testing, providing helpers, abstractions of browser pages, and test cases for E2E tests and L&P tests."
